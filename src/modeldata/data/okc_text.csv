"ok, i really don't know what (if anything) i'm looking for. impress
me. i am a singer, songwriter, poet, amateur photographer and
single mom to a brilliant four-year-old boy. i am a massage
therapist and aesthetician by trade, though i am in the process of
switching careers and becoming an ultrasound tech. i am christian
but also liberal, open-minded and non-judgmental, and i prefer to
be around people like myself. i am somewhat of a homebody but i do
occasionally enjoy going out to karaoke or to check out local
talent. would love to go to a poetry slam or comedy show as well.
at times, i have a rather sick, un-pc sense of humor. i love to
laugh and be silly. friends would describe me as goofy, funny,
generous and loyal.<br />
<br />
i was born and raised in santa cruz and come from a liberal,
down-to-earth family. most of my family members are really into
politics and current events. i am somewhat ashamed to admit that at
the ripe old age of 41, i am only just now beginning to educate
myself on what's going on in the world. i marched with my son in
the occupy oakland rally, and i'm now reading howard zinn's
""peoples' history of the united states"". i would love to meet
someone who would like to discuss current events with a beginner
and wouldn't be judgmengtal about my lack of knowledge.<br />
<br />
one new developement in my life as of late is that i am in the
process of obtaining my foster care license. i am hoping to foster
one child up to the age of six. eventually, i would like to
adopt.<br />
<br />
as far as relationships go, i am not sure what i'm looking for, to
be honest, but i know it ain't a quick hook up. i am a true
romantic and hope to find my forever man one day, but right now i'm
not sure i'm ready for anything too serious. i'd settle for a fun
local friend to go out with. we can take it slow and see if
anything developes.<br />

fun!","procrastinating. crap..i shouldn't say that, should i? i'll change

"i was born in wisconsin, grew up in iowa, and moved to california
three years ago for a combination of work opportunity and just
wanting to live in sf. it took me a couple years to get to the
peninsula, but i'm glad i eventually got here. i'm passionate about
people and have a wide variety of interests and talents.<br />
<br />
i'm also continually learning about myself. for example, i'm
learning very recently that as a result of spending all my time
growing up, in college, and for the last five years focusing on
growing my ""deep relationship"" skills, i'm not as good as i
previously thought at initializing friendships/relationships. i
guess that isn't all a bad thing since the ""first impression"" thing
only really happens once with each person. :)<br />
<br />
as a result, i love my friends, i've got a lot of deep friendships,
and know how much richer a friendship can get as it gets
deeper.<br />
<br />
i'm passionate about music, i play the guitar, write songs (less
now than before), write plays (more now than before), want to learn
french and asl, am pretty good for an amateur ballroom dancer, can
do almost everything moderately well (seriously, no joke), love
bright ties and shoes, am a jacket and jeans person, and absolutely
love figuring out how people tick. i think i'm pretty cool and wish
more people would be patient enough to take the time to see
that.<br />
<br />
every friend i've ever had say i'm nothing like anyone else. so i
don't come off like anyone else. i'm my own person. and i'm proud
of that.","i'm currently the youngest member on an internal strategy team for
a large bank. it may sound boring, but i'm a big fan of the
opportunities it entails. i get to be exposed to really
intelligent, deliberately organized people be purposeful in a high
paced business environment. it's pretty awesome soaking up all
their knowledge while contributing what i can.<br />
<br />
i'm happy with who i am and would enjoy adding someone else to the
mix.","i'm really good at a little bit of everything. there isn't much i
truly excel in, but i'm above average to good in almost every area.
i take pride in being able to do a lot of different things. for
example, i have a tiny bit of talent/skill in writing,
wood-carving, cooking, singing, playing a guitar, drawing, sewing,
etc. i grew up in a household that had to make a lot of the things
we needed, so you kind of picked up these things along the way.","the way i dress. some days it's hats, other days it's different
ties. most days it's shoes and jackets. just another way to express
myself.<br />
<br />
i've also decided that people notice how i'm not what they
expected. i find myself unpurposefully continually surprising
people, and i think i like that. :)","books = yes. avid reader.<br />
moves = eternal sunshine, vanilla sky, stranger than fiction,
garden state, lord of the rings, star wars (the classics),
etc<br />
tv = lost, himym, psych, big bang theory, etc<br />
music = brandi carlile, bon iver, band of horses, killers, etc -- i
have a seriously wide range of musical tastes, not because i don't
have taste but because i believe every genre has talented
musicians<br />
food = sushi, bbq, italian--i like trying things, but often find
myself coming back to the same old, same old","guitar - even if i don't play it all the time, i've got to have it
as an available outlet<br />
corrective lenses - bats can see better than me if i don't have my
glasses<br />
book - always reading--well, not as always as i used to, but still
enough that i feel naked without a book in my bag<br />
ipod - got to have my music; 11,000 songs and counting. :d<br />
car - i really don't like being stuck at home--i don't mind being a
homebody at times, but i don't like being forced to be<br />
money - i've found it's unbelievably hard to find fun things to do
without spending money if you don't want to stay at home","a little bit of everything. but mostly social influences and how
everybody's connected one way or another. there's a fascinating map
of humanity out there, and it's interesting learning how people are
influenced and how they influence.","hanging out with a small group of friends--staying in or going
out--and just enjoying their collective company.","i'm picky when it comes to dating. i know what i'm looking for and
won't waste my time. or hers.","if you know who you are, who you want, where your life is going.
also, i'm a genuine guy who isn't going to be like everyone else.
send me a message if you're patient, willing to take the time to
get to know someone, and are looking for the kind of guy you can
take home to your parents. :)"
"ground rules:<br />
<br />
do not wink at me<br />
do not talk to me about sex in your first message.<br />
do not message me if you have a penis. if you do, the only response
you can hope to get will be....not very nice.<br />
ok, that's really it! &lt;3<br />
<br />
so, i've decided to completely rewrite this, already, after only
having been signed up for a day, because even though i specifically
stated i was more interested in girls, i have received an endless
stream of messages from idiot boys who claim to have read my
profile and think i'm a ""cool chick and we would get along"". news
flash: if you can't read, we won't get along.<br />
<br />
also, look, changed my sexual preference to gay. now maybe i'll
stop getting eleventy two million messages a day from things
without vaginas!<br />
<br />
yes, i am stereotypically club girl attractive. yes, i like to
drink, i smoke on occasion, and when i go out i have a tendency to
dress like a slut. yes, i have casual sex listed as something in
which i'm interested. no, that doesn't mean i want to fuck
everything that moves, and no, it does not mean that offering me
pictures of your cock is going to make me want it.<br />
<br />
this is exactly why i am so turned off to men right now. it seems
that you're all retarded.<br />
<br />
anyway, all that aside, i am, in fact, a nice girl, and i don't act
like a bitch for no reason. i like normal things like a normal
person, and when i'm not out partying, i'm probably working or
playing video games. like a god damn normal person. so please, if
you're going to message me and you aren't a girl, at least make it
some kind of interesting? i really hate reading the same message 20
times a day.","well, since i just turned 21, life has ben a party, and i think i'm
doing it well! lol!<br />
<br />
when i'm not out with my gurls though, i work as a server, and am
working to get my bartenders license! i love my drinks, haha.","well, dancing, singing loudly in the shower, rockband (i will kick
your ass), i used to do gymnastics in high school, so i'm pretty
good at being bendy, lol~! ummmm, i dunno, i guess i'll think about
it and add as i go!","either that i'm laughing or that my hair is too blonde to be
natural, hahaha.<br />
<br />
you tell me!","i don't have much time for reading these days, but i always always
always have my ipod on! i love ke$ha and mariah carey, and anything
they play in ""da club"" lol!<br />
<br />
i love pizza, sushi, and drinks with umbrellas in them!<br />
<br />
ugh. gonna be honest. writing like that really hurts my life.","1) my dog, pookie.<br />
2) music lol<br />
3) strawberry and cherry chapstick<br />
4) laughter<br />
5) cuddles<br />
6) my grrrrrrrls! hahahaha.","the environment and how we are totally, like, killing it. you
know?<br />
<br />
ok not really, i think about sparkly pink shit, obviously. :)","out with my girls, sipping on joose! lol! maybe we'll bump into
each other! ;)<br />
<br />
keep an eye out, i'll be the one dancing on the bar!<br />
<br />
is that what you wanted to see? no? oh, my apologies.","i own a several hand held gaming devices specifically to play
pokemon.","you aren't an idiot. you actually read my profile, and can offer
something i might be interested in responding to using the
information you've been given."
"i am a man who really likes to have a great time no matter what i
do. i'm definitely a people person.i tend to make new friends very
easily and people are naturally drawn to my warmth and sunny
nature. don't worry, i am honest enough to still have some
misanthropic feelings towards my fellow man from time to time. i'm
not pollyanna, but i am naturally optimistic, so you've been
warned. i'm kind of a brainiac but not obnoxious about it. i'm
drawn to these same characteristics in women.brains,cuteness and
genuine sweetness make me want to lavish a women with...let's say a
lush and sensuous garden of earthly delights.<br />
<br />
i am fascinated by so many things in life from the grand, sprawling
and epic, to the small and shiny. i am still up for adventures,
believe me, but i've also learned enough, that at this point i find
stability hot.","i work for a local university and i also coach a high school

professionally and personally.the personal stuff is pretty
wide-ranging from meta-physics and various spiritual ideas, to

"in a relationship with <a class=""plink"" href=
""/profile/corispence"">corispence</a>, a gorgeous and talented
artist and aspiring chef. we would like to meet a woman to join
us....<br />
<br />
grew up in brooklyn and have not fully lost that east coast edge
even though i have lived here in the bay area for well over a
decade. my education was in florida where i earned a degree in
anthropology and then did graduate studies in ethnomusicology where
i began playing shakuhachi, a japanese bamboo flute.<br />
my most recent musical project is redoing soundtracks to old silent
films by yasujiro ozu.<br />
<br />
for 2 decades i have been a professional musician and music
teacher. shakuhachi is my instrument which is an bamboo flute from
japan.<br />
<br />
in addition, i am self employed as a vegetarian (actually vegan but
i do not like to use the word as it scares many people away) chef
with my own personal chef and catering business as well as teaching
cooking classes and hosting an ongoing dinner/concert series
(sometimes referred to as a secret supper club or underground
restaurant).<br />
<br />
i am an avid film watcher, observer and listener and taster of
various art forms.<br />
<br />
love to travel and hiking through the redwoods gives me incredible
joy. recently rediscovering my love of cycling. purchased a new
road bike recently and am riding 150 or miles per week, now.
decided to stop driving a car unless needed for business so using
the bike for local errands and also getting out and around northern
california.....seeing this beautiful area at 15-20 mph is quite a
blast!!<br />
<br />
japan is the country i have spent most time outside of the states
and i have always been attracted to various aspects of japanese
culture since i was a young child.<br />
<br />
spiritual yet not religious. was raised reformed jewish and have
studied buddhism as an adult.<br />
<br />
huge soccer fan! used to play and now just observe. love to watch
teams like barcelona and arsenal with their virtuosity teamwork and
skills. however my politics leads me to be a huge fan of fc st
pauli and also celtic. :)<br />
<br />
casual, infrequent drinker and love belgian ales, fine wines and
occasional brandies or apertifs both to sip as well as to cook
with. enjoy smoking a good bowl as well.<br />
<br />
very progressive in my political beliefs and actively engage them
in my daily lifestyle. back in college it occurred to me that we
can easily change much of the corporate takeover of the world by
simply avoiding all, or as much of their products as possible. so
for me, it is a lifestyle of choices that i decided back in college
when i started to really became aware of social, ecological,
economic and political problems.<br />
<br />
total turnoffs to me: republicans, chest tatoos, most hip hop and
so called progressives and liberals who still think obama will
actually change something. ok, i just alienated a large part of the
bay area community :)<br />

food<br />
i am a total foodie and this is one of my professions. constantly
studying food and further developing and refining my skills in the
kitchen. i greatly enjoy blowing peoples minds and attitudes about
vegetarian/vegan cuisine out the window. gone are the myths of
brown rice, steamed vegetables with some salt; replacing it by
taking full advantage of a 12 month, local harvest combined with
the variety of ingredients due to the diverse community along with
a diverse knowledge of many world culinary traditions. like i do
with music, i study the traditions and then try to take it to a new
realm and there is nothing more fun than sharing this with
others!<br />
i love japanese, sichuan, thai, vietnamese, italian, middle eastern
as well as a fondness for my ancestors eastern european jewish
cuisine. as a chef i like to prepare everything from scratch, no
packaged goods of any sort so i make my own tempeh, tofu, cashew
based ice creams, various kinds of noodles and much more; lessening
the global footprint of my kitchen as well as providing the
freshest flavors and textures. love to explore and experiment in
the kitchen, want to help?<br />

babies are terrified of me but little kids love me..<br />
<br />
i'm no mountain lion wrestling, wilderness camping, crapping in

i'm not big into animals especially wild ones..although have been

<br />
i'd like to get out more. i love to go for dinner at posh joints,
sip martini's in fancy hotel bars, see movies etc.. all the normal
stuff but haven't gotten back into the groove of doing this alone..
so i stay home and work work work. i'd like to find someone who can
inspire me to get out a little more. i like my work so i'm not
complaining but really, ..please... somebody ask me out;-)<br />
<br />
what else......?<br />
i have an ear for accents i would love to learn to speak spanish
but i'm too busy/lazy to learn.<br />
<br />
i like to stay informed about current affairs but i'm not a burned
out overly intellectual news junky. my politics lie left of center
but i don't trust michael moore. i'm considered barely educated
since i left school when i was 16 but what i know i have learned
from living and travelling.<br />
<br />
i had a couple of scary life changing experiences recently that
showed me a few things about perspective..so i'm putting myself out
there and who knows maybe i can find another true love before i die
and if not then a few good female friends to explore with would be
very pleasant!<br />
<br />
i am artistic, funny, and passionate","playing music. rehearsing, recording, writing, performing. there's
still some magic left for us to explore but old habits and patterns
can get in the way so we have to work even harder to find an
original sound. also busy raising two girls pretty much by
myself... now that's a challenge as i'm not really a kid type guy
nor am i into other peoples kids but they seem to be into
me..anyway i never thought i'd be able to do it until i had to and
to my surprise i like it!<br />
not much else going on..i try to go to every party i'm invited to
but often i'm in bed before 10. i wake up at 5am.. i sometimes
moonlight at a friends restaurant.. one of my other loves is
food..if i wasn't doing music i'd be in the restaurant biz full
time..","connecting with people from other cultures, service, resident evil
zero, cooking......playing soccer.. although i'm not so good at
this these days and being single with two picky kids doesn't allow
me to do much cooking either.. so maybe i should withdraw the
earlier statements!!","my shaved head and my funny accent! that i don't look like brad
pitt or william h macy.","i like it all. a well made hollywood blockbuster ( the dark night
is just as satisfying to me as in arthouse japanese movie (the
twighlight samurai) all depends on my mood. i tend towards reading
literature and i don't include the da vinci code in that list..
(sorry but it was rubbish!). i like richard yates, cormac mc
carthy, ian mckewan et al.<br />

well made fresh local organic but you'd have to pay me more than
$20 to eat kfc *shudder*","music, my girls, the ability to record music, hot passionate slow
sex(like slow food. only tastes better) cold rainy days, the sun,
carnitas burrito from cactus.","how to decipher the news from all sources, how to make more money

feet tall or 250 lbs!<br />
<br />
why do women post pictures of their animals on dating sites? what
have animals got do do with anything unless you've got some ""doggy

whole world. my ex's mother might read this;-)","you have a sense of humour are independent,compassionate, sexy,
have an open heart and mind. i like a woman who has a little bit of
kink to her.. not crazy wild freaky semi deranged.. just a mild
touch. you're smart but down to earth and although you believe in
living unpretentiously you know that's a ridiculous contradiction

definitely have a thing for thin lips (weird, huh?). i have no

[11/13 edit] good freaking spaghetti monster, expand to 1000 words?
do we get copyright on our novellas?! :p<br />
<br />
so, let's see what i've left out. um, a bit of a geek in my
interests - d&amp;d, computer games (rift currently; played eq
&amp; eq2 before that), &amp; the aforementioned birding. used to
love country-western dancing, but haven't been in years (i keep
meaning to get back into it).<br />
<br />
i've taken almost 3 semesters of french now, mainly because i think
frenchmen are hot (generally speaking). i still struggle to
comprehend a word unless it's spoken... very... slowly. not sure if
i'm going to continue or not; i seem to have reached a plateau. i
do like taking an evening class in something once a week, though,
just to keep learning &amp; growing. have my eye on a short story
class, but not sure.<br />
<br />
ok, still not 1000. you know, you'd think they could put in a word
meter if they're going to have a word count requirement,
hmmm?<br />
<br />
anyway... um... oh, i took one of the personality tests which is
based on the myers-briggs type index, &amp; it pegged me as infp.
this is incorrect; i'm intp. perhaps i shouldn't protest too
strongly, though, considering that the test jokingly shows only the
negative personality aspects; switching would mean going from their
joke label of polyanna to... loser. ouch. that said, i'm too much
of a stickler for accuracy (particularly where self-representation
is involved) to just leave it, so i'm sure i'll be taking it a few
more times until it comes out right - which possibly proves their
point. :p<br />

if nostalgia is the pain a dying man feels because he wishes to
return to his native home, and fears never to see it again, then i
am a petty nostalgist. no kingdom, no family, no great romance.
shivering maples in summer streetlights. dogs wandering through
yards. great spiking thunderheads. the softly impossible hair on
her face. snow-covered gazebos and bicycles. grit mud and gravel
between toes soaked in rain and runoff. leaping through the tall
grass. the hours spent free. not hardheartedness.<br />
<br />
my first word was ""moon."" i'm told that not long after that first,
i pointed at the sun and said ""hot moon."" so, y'know: smart
kid.<br />
<br />
oh, my second word? ""lunch.""<br />
<br />
i enjoy an argument more than i enjoy agreementbut i do enjoy
both. i am nervy like early devo and twice as sharp. i thrive on
anxiety. i am often at my happiest when everything feels awkward. i
am the freest of free-associators and a highly skilled devil's
advocate.<br />
<br />
i have a love of talk. i am made of time. i am
nautically-themed.<br />
<br />
my heart's fondest ambition is to lead a life that allows me to
take nothing <em>seriously</em> ever again. no:
<em>seriously</em>.<br />

houseinfinite.tumblr.com, @houseinfinite on twitter.","doing things the hard way. learning to preserve my joints. running
like the dickens. watching fitness videos on youtubebut
<em>only</em> for the advice, obviously. trying to figure out which
bus line will take me to muir woods. spending as much time in
golden gate park as possible. walking around with a stack of index
cards. using every typographical glyph that exists. eating things
with amusing names. mmmmm: <em>larb</em>.<br />
<br />
as life itself expands to fill all available space, so my life
expands to fill all possible free time. at present, i am: an
(actual) author of short stories, an (aspiring?) author of novels
(the most time consuming, mind-flaying, and crazy-making endeavor a
human being can undertake), a freelance writer and copyeditor, an
underpaid (read: unpaid) music journalist, a literacy volunteer in
the mission and a private tutor.<br />
<br />
i love my jobs, but particularly the teaching. i love to teach. fun
stuff, and very gratifying. if i didn't need the money, i'd happily
do it for free. (important note: i need the money.)<br />
<br />
(important update: i am now doing it for free.)<br />
<br />
as for the writing: i write and i write and i never get any god
damn better at it. but i enjoy it more and more and more, or at
least i tell myself with greater frequency that my enjoyment is
increasing. let us call the writing equidistant from (and
orthogonal to) both ""pleasure"" and ""compulsion.""<br />
<br />
i am also a bit of a sartorialist. i try to beand am a sucker
fora well-dressed human.<br />
<br />
i enjoy teaching myself things. last year i made my own paper, took
up canning (good plum jam is hard to find, which is a shame because
it is one of the best things ever invented), made some electronic
music and brute-forced my way through a calculus textbook. this
year: french, crochet, juggling, linear algebra, and probably some
kind of crazy dance.<br />
<br />
i have an off-again-off-again love affair with physical fitness. i
hereby dedicate myself to training for the half-marathon this
august. motivate me. please, someone motivate me.","doing things that are difficult, because they are difficult.
running long distances at an even, measured pace. being extremely
hard on myself for failure, but not congratulating myself for
success. navel-gazing. push-ups. eating.<br />
<br />
not buying things, not owning things, borrowing things, returning
things, cooking a delicious meal, crosswords, climbing rocks and
trees, getting stubborn mildew out of tile grout, staying in bed on
a sunday morning, foot massages (giving and receiving), spelling
the word ""receiving"" correctly without the aid of a computer, being
self-(read: un-)employed, using parentheses in new and interesting
ways, talking a whole lot, looking in the mirror, not looking in
the mirror, thinking of things i'm really good at, being nice to
children and elders, reading stories out loud in funny voices,
dancing (although ""really good"" is a bit relative here; do you
think the most hilarious dance you've ever seen is ""really good?""),
dressing myself (what's up dudes, pick a decent shirt for once),
being able to make a total mess without even trying, laying in a
grassy meadow and accurately describing the shapes of clouds...

literature, art and science outnumbering references to pop culture;
sense of humor (i.e. likes me, thinks i'm funny); carries a book
with him or her just in case something boring continues to happen;
alertness/awareness/attention (i find dullness and disinterest
terribly unattractive); exciting/manually demonstrative speaking;
intellectual (i.e. likes me, thinks i'm funny).","this is the kind of thing i find is fun to talk about in person

weeks ago and that was mindwreckingly good. i believe david byrne

for that.<br />
<br />
food: opportunist! i love making and eating bread, but i've been
trying to get off white flour, and seriously fuck spelt. so
vegetables, i guess. lentils, broccoli, brussels sprouts, carrots,
celery. these are all examples of vegetables. i don't like raw
tomatoes, though, so if you're into that kind of freaky shit then
you can pass right by me, sister.<br />

love to change that..... maybe.","over sensitive and prone to stressing out occasionally. im a pretty
open book, yes thats very clich and so is this.","if your interested, and are good at hugging."
"i'm shy and soft spoken, but get along with most people. i'm also
family oriented and looking for someone to eventually spend the
rest of my life with (kind of sappy).<br />
<br />
my life right now has been primarily routine lately (work, eat,
sleep), which isn't necessarily a bad thing when i do compliment
this with periodic activities with friends and/or family (and once
in awhile strictly by my lonesome). i understand there are a lot of
things i still haven't done in my life (i.e. i have debated about
skydiving), but i am relatively open to try new things, especially
when accompanying others.","taking long walks, going to the gym, watching movies (mostly
rental), singing (not very good though), taking pictures (not a
professional), traveling domestically/internationally, hanging out
with friends, spending time with family... i love to dance and when
the occasion arises at parties i love to participate. who's up for
the electric slide?","i'm a good friend and people can count on me. friends and family
have said i'm humorous. i'm somewhat decent with technological
devices, albeit i'm not one to find the need to get the latest and
greatest devices either.",i've been told i have a nice smile and very polite.,"i'm not an avid book reader as i use to, but i enjoyed angels and
demons, survivor's club, les misrables and the harry potter
series. if comics count [though i do not collect anymore] i'm a fan
of the archie comics series, which influenced my profile
name.<br />
<br />
my favorite movies are groundhog day, inception, my fair lady,
indiana jones series, toy story series and the lord of rings
series.<br />
<br />
as to music i guess you can say i like the genres easy listening
and soft rock. my favorite musical artist include abba, air supply,
carpenters, elton john, linda ronstadt, sarah mclachlan and
stylistics (i guess i'm stuck primarily in the 70s or 80s).<br />
<br />
i don't really watch tv much with exception of the news. i am
relatively open to watch whatever anyone is watching in the room,
but i'm beginning to enjoy the big bang theory. a friend said i was
like sheldon, but i can assure you i'm not. he has more game than i
do.<br />
<br />
my favorite types of food are chinese and italian.","family, friends, love, a [digital] camera, the internet and lotion.","relationships (not in one, but would eventually like to), travel
(possible future destinations, but not including the moon), music
(i'm constantly playing some type of tune in my head), space and
work (pulling hair. argh!!!).","i stare up at the sky looking at where i think the stars might be.
darn the fog. on a serious note i might be browsing online and/or
catching up on my magazines. i am actually finding myself looking
at the early morning/night sky more often due to my renewed
interest in space.","fetishes, quirks, etc. are meant for conversations down the line in
a relationship. as to something i can volunteer here... i like to
quote lyrics to a song in a conversation or actually try to sing
part of a song in relation to a topic.","if you had the tolerance to read all the dialogue above and still
hold an interest i thank you. now see below for all the remainder
fun stuff, which might deter the remainder 99% of women who visit
my profile (or attract; i don't know):<br />
<br />
message me if you're looking for someone honest, sincere, faithful
and actually looking for a relationship. also...<br />
<br />
the person i'm looking for should be generally optimistic. i'm not
talking about ""ned flanders"" positive, but i prefer to not hear
constantly in a conversation about how the world is against her or
gripe about her ex-boyfriend. despite the general consensus i'm not
a professional therapist. i'm willing to listen to people
(particularly friends) and provide feedback, but this just kills
the mood.<br />
<br />
i like dancing. unless you have a walking disability i would like
to dance with you eventually. i'm not the most graceful dancer on
the floor, but i enjoy this social interaction. i took a ballroom
dancing class ages ago and i'm feeling this has gone to waste. in
fact i might have to reference back to my paper material to refresh
my memory (or make a futile attempt at taking lessons with youtube
clips). if you don't know how to dance we can learn together."

"i am a pretty laid back person, kind of artsy and romantic, also
very honest. i would say that i'm a combination of jaded and
hopeful, peppered with a somewhat dark sense of humor. i do tend to
be pretty positive, in general, and try to make the best out of any
given situation. living in the moment is a work in progress, but
it's something i strive to do. i'm the person that people lean on
when they need help, but am also fiercely independent and somewhat
off-beat in a fun, bay area sort of way.","i'm a student at uc berkeley studying film. i'm a creative soul, so
that mainly means that i like to write, and of course read. i

leaving the bay area after 10 years here to go and live/study in

harmonica that i play here and there, whenever i can. i'm always
looking for people who want to jam.<br />

i love games from table top to video games, i try my hand at them
all. but for me a few stand out above all of the rest. super puzzle
bubble bobble, tetris, and pacman, galaga, are just a sampling of
my favorite retro games. the final fantasy series have never failed
me. neither has shin megami tensi, or the legeand of zelda. kingdom
hearts is one of my favorite games series of all time. halo and
call of duty are two of my favorite shooters. assassins creed cures
my need to jump from building to building screaming ""i'm the
freaking spiderman"" and grand theft auto is always a fun way to
relieve stress. resident evil and left 4 dead top my zombie list.
and there's no way i can ever forget the thing that's going to
steal my soul one of these day. world of warcraft. but it'll have
to be my current obsession/game/hobby wahammer 40 thousand a table
top miniatures game. it's one part hobby, one part, game, and ten
parts rage inducing fun. if that made any sense at all.","friends, music, video games, the internets,hot pockets (with out
them it would be impossible to eat and game at the same time),
sleep, and as an honorary mention air becasue with out it i'd most

vegans or vegetarians as long as i'm allowed to express freely my

several labels and enjoying world wide releases. i have spent an

<br />
i am a passionate, playful, intellectually curious, and genuine
person always looking for a challenge and something new to try and
learn. my friends would describe me as ethical, kind, empathetic,
silly, creative, and quirky. laughter and humor are important to
me. i have a whimsical outlook on life, which helps me stay
grounded in the work that i do. i am a social worker (m.s.w)
working in the field of policy advocacy and violence prevention. i
also work in the clinical field as a family crisis counselor and as
a therapist for children, youth, and families. working towards
positive social change and social justice are very important to me.
i feel privileged that my job is not only a job but a way of life
that affords me great meaning. daily, i encounter the resilience of
the human spirit and have experiences that inform my world view and
challenge me to grow and learn as a person.<br />

i also love creating art for fun. i like to experiment with
charcoal, acrylic paints, and clay.<br />

sidelined from the sport for a while but i am working towards

love hiking and being outdoors.<br />

"back in the bay after a long hiatus.<br />
<br />
i tend not to like to summarize, as a i really dislike being
typecast. i'm happiest when i'm learning, and have really broad
interests--it's always a struggle to find balance and fulfillment
among intellectual/idealistic/artistic/athletic pursuits. my
academic interests have tended to involve international studies
(law/politics/econ), but also international lit.<br />
<br />
but i'm pretty content to be in the bay these days. i'm pretty well
traveled, at least in the western hemisphere. have studied and
lived abroad in various places--budapest/chile/buenos aires.<br />
<br />
i'd like to think of myself as pretty humble and fair-minded, but i
also enjoy arguing a bit. rest assured that it's nothing personal.
my friends inevitably tend to have strong opinions and relate to
the world intellectually--they are creative lawyer types,
scientists, artists.<br />
<br />
sense of humor is deadpan, with absurd highlights and a smidge of
snark--but only when you have it coming ;)<br />
<br />
i'm generally suspicious of archetypes, but if infj means anything
attractive to you, then perhaps i'm your huckleberry.","career-wise, i gravitate towards work that i get to feel good
about: social justice at home and abroad, environmental law.
work-life balance is important to me--my union lawyer gig suits me
pretty well, at least for the moment. i've worked in a lot of
different areas: helping draft constitutions in developing
countries, managing after-school programs for kids, working in
sound tech, to name just a few.<br />
<br />
in my free time, i like to get down, play capoeira, and watch an
occasional soccer game. i spend a lot of time hiking in the east
bay's regional parks with my pup, and love backpacking.<br />
<br />
i also enjoy tinkering around the house, building virtual machines,
planting shit, people-watching.","problem solving, writing, most anything athletic.","eyes, legs, wit. in that order.","i'm partial to satires, brilliant prose, and pretty much any art
that can get the wheels turning in my head. favorite authors
include salman rushdie, victor pelevin. i seem to really like early
20th century german literature.<br />
<br />
fave filmmakers would be: tarkovsky, coen bros, jp jeunet,
kusturica, miyazaki, greenaway, wenders, etc etc.<br />
<br />
fave music: i tend to digest a lot of music, and am a bit of a
musical novelty seeker, so originality and complexity are good
qualities: battles, grizzly bear, animal collective, most anything
on warp records or ninja tune. this could be a very long
list.<br />
<br />
food--i'm easy to please. i try to keep it healthy, so please let
me know if i have any kale bits stuck in my teeth. or maybe that's
a piece of steak?","spotify, netflix, the outdoors, my vizsla pup, good friends,

"my name is matt and i am new to alameda. just to start off, do not
judge a person by the way they look. get to know them. i love to
laugh a lot and i have to have a girl who likes to laugh. i try and

towards the personality then the looks of the girl. that is what

around me. i have tons of friends and i am constantly talking to
them to keep in touch. i will admit i do play video games but they

"i'm a curious person, interested in how the world works (mostly
people, but okay, motors too). i'm a default extrovert, prone to
talking to strangers in public. the secret is simple: ask people
about themselves and they'll usually tell you something interesting
(i.e. ""cool dog. does he know any tricks?"" or ""where do
<em>you</em> eat in this neighborhood?"" ). i'm
philosophically-minded, but also pretty silly for a
professor.<br />
<br />
i grew up a suburban kid in the pre-tech, pre-""play date"" days,
building skateboard ramps and running around town
unchaperoned--that is to say a normal, hands-on 70's childhood in a
family that's still very close. i have a couple of nice gadgets,
but i try to keep daily screen/tech time to a minimum,
<em>much</em> preferring coffee with a friend to facebook or
whatever.<br />
<br />
what else? i have a soft spot for crafters, enthusiasts and people
who root for the underdog (not the underdogs themselves--screw
them! ha-ha). i'm not your tall-dark-rockhardabs-type romeo, but
i'm a fun date, respectful, a good conversationalist, not

worlds that you probably wouldn't stumble into without them.

i'm a movie freak. i'll go any night of the week, and sometimes do!
i work at the telluride film festival every year i like them so
much... i'd have to say my favorite all time movie is wild at

fight club and adam sandler comedies.<br />
<br />
music: this is where i lose most people, unfortunately. i listen to
heavy music. yes, i like metal, but i also like many other types of
music. i am into stoner rock (which mostly stems from black
sabbath). my favorite band of all time is kyuss. they turned into
queens of the stone age. i feel really strongly about music, and
i'm tired of having people look down upon folks who like heavier
music as ""immature"" or ""angry"". i can promise you that i'm most at
peace listening to a good mid-tempo chugga-chugga exodus riff. i'll

"a grounded seeker of new perspectives, learning and experiences, i
value expansion, freedom, growth, openness, tolerance, and
connecting. it's from this angle that i approach life.<br />
<br />
i have way too many things on my life list and not enough time to
get to them as fast as i'd like to (yet!). i'm fueled by the
incessant desire to do, learn, taste, feel into, and experience new
things, and i've got a lot of range i can be extremely disciplined
and focused in my endeavors, but must carve out time for play and
letting my hair down in order to maintain my homeostasis. drop me
in any situation and i'll figure it out and make the most of it.
i'm pretty playful and have high appreciation for good times with
good company (ideally paired with good food!). lately i've been
incorporating as much movement as possible in my life. i love to
dance and get lost in a good beat and get mesmerized by good live
music. i love getting out of dodge to connect with nature and
re-ground. i can get down with some yoga, a nice long run and love
riding my bike around town. i'm also adept at handling fast pieces
of machinery with two wheels ;). gotta love two-wheel therapy.","for work, currently i'm pushing forward efforts to connect people
that want to connect....and on the side (for now), am in the
process of manifesting my dream to heal with food... working my way
towards my certification as a holistic nutrition coach - - ultimate
goal...to be able to work from anywhere i want, connect, support,
heal, inspire and be inspired.<br />
<br />
overall, i'm working hard to create a life that truly resonates
with who i am and what i have to give - - one that teaches,
intrigues and inspires. and ultimately, would love to have a
partner in crime to share that with.","... dancing, riding fast motorcycles, smiling, laughing, expressing
myself, motivating others, talking shit, playing sports, listening

flow, having fun, being playful and (when inspired) a little
mischievous ...",my smile,"i'm a bit of a reader with add...typically read several books at
once and a lot of non-fiction but love, love, love a good novel (if
you care to make any recommendations, i'm all ears). some general

new earth, food politics... to give you a feel for where i'm at
right now....i'm reading the presence process (m.brown), the mood
cure (j.ross), dear lover (d.deida), and m.rosenberg's non violent
communication.<br />
<br />
movies...generally watch independent, foreign, drama,
documentaries. i tend to enjoy films that touch on one of the many
aspects inherent to the essence of humanity.<br />
<br />
music...i love it and listen to it all the time and my tastes are
extremely eclectic...preference for anything with an international
beat, but in general i like downtempo, breakbeat, house, trip hop,
funk, afrobeat, soul, conscious hip hop, latin and brazilian pop,
salsa, pagode, classic rock and some heavier stuff, roots reggae,
jazz.<br />

"i love to talk. it's my favorite thing to do. i'm inquisitive and i
laugh easily. i want to share coffee or tea, talk a lot, laugh, and
get to know some interesting new people, allowing friendship to
bloom into romance over time. i am a therapist by day, and a
homebody when i can be. i love my chosen family, which is very rich
and varied, and members of my related family have come back into my
life in a wonderful way lately. i am a dog person and allergic to
cats. you'll find me swimming a few times a week. i'm 30 years
clean and sober and prefer that drugs &amp; alcohol are a
take-it-or-leave-it thing (if at all) for anyone close to me.
social justice is extremely important to me and is woven into the
fabric of my life. and i love to talk. love it.<br />
<br />
the woman i'm looking for is ..... many things, but here are my
deal-breakers:<br />
<br />
comfortable in her own body and appreciative of mine. that goes for
size, shape, inside and out.<br />
<br />
self-aware and able to converse about feelings, engage in
constructive conflict resolution and won't shy away from talking
about what's real.<br />
<br />
butch of center. that's where my chemistry gets churning.<br />
<br />
i am easy to laugh, sensitive, and enthusiastic. and i'm worth it.","working at a demanding full time job as a psychiatric social
worker, with a small private practice on the side as a
psychotherapist. i derive a great deal of pleasure in visiting with
my friends, old and new, playing with my dogs &amp; their dog
friends, swimming and romping in the pool a few times a week, and
finding nooks and crannies in my life to relax, lounge in my
pajamas, be creative (jewelry making &amp; crocheting).","laughing, talking about important or silly things. talking about my
feelings, and accepting constructive criticism. i have really good
boundaries, so i won't diagnose or ""therapize"" unless invited.","my smile, which comes easily and often.","ecclectic, but sushi, classical music, and chocolate are on the
list. i prefer a drama to an action movie, and comedy if it isn't
at someone's expense. jazz, blues, and music that is live are my
favorites, and i prefer 3-dimensional art, and performance or
experiencial to flat art on walls. coffee might be first on the
list.","my dogs, my family, my comfy bed, time alone, good food and
laughter, not at all in that order. or all at once (well, almost).","all the ways the world could be better, and how so much human
energy is squandered. but lately that makes me aggravated, so i'm
in a period of examining how i can put forth my effort and accept
the wonderfulness of others, as chaotic as it can be.","tired from a week of work, but i can be convinced to go out for a
quiet dinner, a low-key outing, being outside as the sunlight
recedes. if i'm alone, i might do any of those things, or be at
home unwinding and laughing at my dogs.","even though people see me as social and confident, i have a shy,
tentative underside to me.","you like what you see, want to know more, have any questions."
"my life's goal is to have a whippet named minnow that i've raised
from six weeks until the end of her very long life. i dream of
living in a cute corner townhouse in sf, boston, dc, austin... so
many amazing choices. get me started on my townhouse life and i'll
talk for days. (okay, to be fair, i can carry on a lovely
conversation with a brick wall. i love to talk, and i'm not half
bad at it.)<br />
<br />
if there's a will, there's a way. i'm all about it. my slogan is
#totallydoable (okay, i have a lot of catchphrases - ask me about
them).<br />
<br />
i prefer to speak in declarative sentences.<br />
<br />
when i find someone i love, whether it's romantic or not, i'm
fiercely loyal. so far it's never been tested to the point of
impractically, but it's a part of who i am. to me, it's worth it to
stick up for and to stick with the people i care about. if that
means i have to stand up for you or hang tight when you're going
through a rough patch, so be it.","saving our public schools.<br />
<br />
okay, okay, not by myself! i'm dedicated to education reform from
the ground up. that means i'm not primarily concerned with
curriculum or teacher training. we absolutely have got to do
something about socioeconomic inequality before we're going to
accomplish anything else. i didn't come to stanford from a first
gen, low-income background to abandon everything that's made me who
i am. i want to get a jd/phd once i finish here, because that's
what i do. i'm a university student, sure, but i'm a lifelong
student. i love everything about academia and might just get stuck
there if i can find out how to combine making a change in the world
whilst buried in books. if there's a way, i'll find it.","harry potter.<br />
<br />
making a house a home. it's all about details. like when you come
home, it should smell like freshly-baked cinnamon struesel muffins.
crossing the threshold into my dorm room is like sinking into my
favorite lounge chair.<br />
<br />
cooking and baking, maybe? okay, that's 100% a total and complete
lie. ""really good"" is a stretch at best. i have my signature dishes
- savory pancakes, shrimp alfredo bake, yellow cake - but i'm still
learning. i just picked it up this summer. yeah, this summer, when
i needed help cracking an egg (laugh all you want). but i love it.
setting out the supplies, putting everything together, getting a
product that so many love (okay, sometimes i just totally screw up,
too).<br />
<br />
i'm also really good at getting down to business to defeat the
huns. (it's a mulan reference.)<br />
<br />
i'm really good at leaving tokens of appreciation. i want to figure
out your favorite candy, something for your favorite hobby, the
kind of little notes that brighten your day. if you bake your
feelings i want to bring you brown sugar. if you paint i'll find a
tube of color you don't have yet. if you love only the pink
starbust, i'll buy three packs and pick them out for you. it's what
i do.<br />
<br />
board games. actually, i'm terrible at them. let's play dominion
together.","when i get enthusiastic, i get enthusiastic. modulating excitement
isn't my strong point. i'm a complete sucker for jacobsian urban
design. if you know what that is, i want you in my life. preferably
today. sometimes enthusiasm translates into competitiveness - but
if i'm being competitive, you can bet i'm having a good time.<br />
<br />
i have clear, soft skin with a great milky complexion. whenever i
wear dresses in the winter with bare legs (which is far too often
for my own good - i'm chronically under-dressed), people wonder why
someone my age even owns panty hose. they're not panty hose. i just
have great skin.<br />
<br />
sometimes my nose sweats. yes, no, really, just my nose.
temperature and exertion are irrelevant, apparently.<br />
<br />
i have a ""uniform"" and when i deviate, people notice. i have a
shelf of cardigans, a shelf of dresses, and a shelf of leggings or
tights. i'm particular and i only like my favorite three pairs of
shoes, which has actually kind of decreased to one pair. on
occasion you'll catch me in jeans; if i'm writing a particularly
grueling paper i might whip out the yoga pants. i have a bathing
suit i've only worn once because i believe swimming is best done
spontaneously.","i'm searching the united states for the best shrimp alfredo.
currently, crepevine has the lead, with a local at-home restaurant
in a close second. i love shrimp. i'm allergic to them, and i just
don't care. i also love pasta. and cheese. i think my choice of
shrimp alfredo should now be clear.<br />
<br />
i could list my favorites, but instead i'm going to list some items
from each category that may not be my favorite, but that were most
""revolutionary"" to me.<br />
<br />
books<br />
the hunger games trilogy<br />
flowers for algernon<br />
brave new world<br />
there are no children here<br />
a people's history of the united states (in progress)<br />
<br />
food<br />
chocolate chip cookies - everyone loves cookies (okay, not
everyone). cookies were really the first thing i made when i was
learning how to cook. i love baking, but mostly, i don't love
baking at all, which means i've eaten a lot of dough and batter in
my day.<br />
<br />
art<br />
""the revolution will not be televised""<br />
city in a birdcage","black cardigans<br />
internet connectivity, preferably 24/7<br />
dogs, especially my baby, lucy<br />
creative endeavors, no matter how much i suck at them<br />
my three best friends<br />
flip-flops and other open-toed shoes","well, i can tell you i've spent a lot of time thinking about these
essays. a friend suggested i be ""charming"" and insert more ""me""
because apparently i'm ""damn charming"" sometimes. riiiiiight. what
does that mean?<br />
<br />
i spend a lot of time worrying, but that has this amazing upside.
i'm an organizer. i like to see things happen. i can get five
friends together from opposite sides of campus in no time at all.
but in all this organizing, i'm falling in love with spontaneity. i
spend a lot of time thinking about going on adventures. about
dancing in underground bathrooms at nighttime after a great date.
about how to insert more harry potter references into my daily
life.<br />
<br />
the next time i get to take my pants off. not in a sexual way, in
an i-hate-wearing-pants way.","it takes a half an hour to herd my friends from lgbt happy hour to
the nearest dining hall, but it's worth it - there's a new story
every week, and everyone knows i love to tell stories. an hour of
communing, dining on bread to soak up the alcohol, and giggling
leads to a show or a rendezvous with board games/whatever's

non-existent) significant other and i talk, craft, study, cuddle.
go to sleep early so we can wake up for a saturday morning urban
adventure. with dancing. and space phones, except first we'll get
lost intentionally. because who cares? let's be us.","sometimes i tear up when listening to my favorite music. even if
it's eminem or, like, pitbull. oh yeah, and i guess that means i
have to admit i love pop music. deal with it. my number one
favorite song of all time is ""love the way you lie"" by eminem and
rhianna, so let's talk about its politics.<br />
<br />
i'm demisexual. demisexuality, for me, means my sexuality is
limited to only to those with whom i have a deep connection, and
sometimes then only under circumstances. demisexuality does not
mean i'm not romantic (in fact, i'm hopelessly romantic), and it
does not mean i'm not interested in physical contact.","you're a sucker for intellectual conversation.<br />

really is home. i studied theater in college (lighting design) and
i have a day job in biotech. i'm a bit of a jill of all trades,
i've done a lot of different (all mostly legal) things in my life
career-wise and have some experience doing quite a few different
things (ask me about the time i was a professional kite flyer for a

short story right now, freakonomics, room with a view. shoot, i'll
read anything, though, i like books a lot.<br />
<br />
b) the princess bride, bullit, rear window, mostly martha, mr. nice
guy, sean of the dead, some like it hot, run lola run, all eddy
izzard dvds (not sure if those count as movies, exactly but it's
true.)<br />
<br />
c) this is always the hardest one. i really do like something from
every genre. one day it's lil' kim the next leontyne price (don't
know who she is? she's la prima donna assoluta. google her, it'll
be good for you.), it just depends on my mood. i also really don't
listen to music very much. when i'm driving or at the gym, but for
the most part that's about it, so i don't have any driving, hard
core commitment to or hate for anything... except creed. i hate
creed. yes, they did wrong me. it is personal. it is a long
story.<br />
<br />
d) homemade mac and cheese, chicken tikka masala, gumbo, corned
beef (but only when you cook it right, like i do), really good
cheeseburgers, and chocolate. i could eat burritos every day.","i'm going to assume the basics of survival are covered here.<br />

"i make music, dj, play outside in the sun, enjoy weight training

like to go out to bars and clubs. i grew up a raver in the early
90's and have been djing &amp; playing live all over the world for
20 years. these days i am more mellow, and help run a global record
label here in sf. i take my job seriously and have been extremely
successful following my passions, which currently led me to become
an executive at a video game company. i am great at disconnecting
when i go home, and ensure my free time is spent outdoors or in the
studio banging out techno or future bass. ok, and maybe i'll sneak
in a video game or two when no one's looking ;). i'm loyal and
kind; smart, happy, and fun. i always have a smile on my face and
would love someone to share my happiness with.","working hard, playing hard, and loving my little one.
professionally, i'm advancing through the ranks of executive
management of a game company, and loving every moment of it. i'm
also running an electronic dance record label with a group of
friends, and our latest album just hit #1 on several charts. i
continually work on my music production and have a huge home studio
filled with synths and drum machines. we have a lot of fun in there
needless to say. i also spend lots of time with my little squirt
who is seven and my best friend. me and her are two peas in a pod,
and she rocks worlds everywhere she goes. i'm also spending a lot
of time weight training which i discovered in the last few years
and am really loving it. i find myself picking up lots of sports
now like skiing and running and am really enjoying pushing myself
athletically.","business and music. i rock my job and am amazing at everything
busisness related. i have a knack for making money and treat it
like a game. it's actually a lot of fun once you get good at it
i've found. i'm also really good at making music, specifically
electronic music like house, techno, bass, etc. i've been writing
tunes for so long and it is such a passion of mine i've become an
expert in electronic production and help folks all over sf become
better producers and djs. one thing im good at is socializing. i
can walk in to a room full of people and know them all in short
order. i love people and i love chatting; few things are better
than hanging out with newfound friends, and i'm a natural talent
when it comes to good times. i'm also really good at video games
but we won't go there right now ;)","i have a ton of energy and am nearly always smiling and enjoying
myself.","game of thrones is my favorite book right now (actually book three
is the best so far). the big lebowski is my favorite movie, and the
original tron is a close second. don't even talk to me about the
new tron as i'm still recovering. i also love the spongebob
squarepants movie and if you think i'm crazy rent it and i will be
vindicated. music wise, aphex twin is the greatest musician of our
time (hands down) and i've been enjoying machinedrum quite a bit
lately. i could go on for hours about music, but lets save that for
a friday night exploring tunes behind the turntables. as far as
food goes, i'm a huge carnivore and enjoy grilling steaks on my
weber with a side of salad and maybe asparagus. throw in a few
fancy cheeses from my pals at whole foods and a killer bottle (or
two) of russian river pinot and i am in heaven. actually i just
made myself hungry.","family, music, friends, books, video games, and wine. food, water
and shelter should be on the list, but i'm not wasting my six on
textbook stuff here.","i actually spend a lot of time thinking about sharing my time with
someone, and who that might be. i am very outgoing and social
publicly, but have been single for some time now. a big part of
that has been introspection on what i actually want out of a
partner in life, and i've found myself taking the time to really
get it right. i think i've really figured it out now, so the next
trick is how to find her...","friday nights have me out in sf with friends painting the town red

i believe that the world is as small or as large as you make it.
i've road-tripped through india and seen my favorite bands in
locales as diverse as berkeley and tokyo. somehow i plan to get the
top of as many mountains around the world as possible. i recently
went to the top of mt. kinabalu in malaysia, and i'm working my way
to do something like kilimanjaro. and if you are lucky you will get
to hear about the many times i've gotten myself into trouble
abroad. however, i've discovered there's as much to experience when
i venture out in san francisco and the rest of the bay area. as
long as you are open to it, adventure can be found anywhere.<br />
<br />
otherwise, i'm always experimenting with cooking. jon stewart &amp;
wes anderson are two of my favorite personalities. i'm all about
passion and if you really love the things you are doing, it'll
probably inspire me.","i'm entering my 3rd year of med school, relishing the mix of thrill
and personal growth that comes with the process. i go down to
stanford and do the caltrain commute, actually enjoying the the bit
of solace i get. i have no idea what doctor i'll become, but travel
will be involved.<br />
<br />
aside from school, i do what most people do in their 20s.","well i am an official rock, paper, scissors champion, but

"i was born in chicago, illinois but moved to southern california
when i was five. i grew up in riverside, california and moved to
northern california after attending college in the sf bay area and
been here ever since.<br />
<br />
recently moved from san jose to oakland and i love it here. it's
not as ghetto or scary as people think!<br />
<br />
my two passions in life are traveling and eating good food. i just
really like food and the whole experience of dining whether it be
in a random back alley hole in the wall place or a nice
restaurant.<br />
<br />
to me, it's all about the whole experience and the story behind the
people, the adventure and the experience. it's about how you feel
in that moment and of course about the food.<br />
<br />
my friends have teased me that when they see a picture of me and
some of my meals that i look like the happiest girl on earth.
sometimes in those brief moments, i believe i am.<br />
<br />
i am a bit of a nerd and quirky at times. love it or hate it...up
to you!<br />
<br />
also, people have called me a bit of a tomboy at times and while i
like dressing up and getting all dolled up just as much as any
other woman, i actually prefer to generally be relaxed and
comfortable.","after having a late career/major change and going back to school, i
have been a registered nurse for over 7 years and absolutely love
it. i currently work at a medical-surgical intensive care
unit.<br />
<br />
i'm a night shift worker who works back to back 12 hour shifts, so
hopefully you can understand this as well because i know it's
difficult for some people. this is a little bit of a bonus though
in some ways since it allows me to have every other week (the
entire week) off. i do like to pick up a lot of overtime though as
well to help me pay for trips and dining adventures.<br />
<br />
about to start crossfit next week. i hope i can keep up with it! it
looks intense, but i""m ready for it!","seeing people and things for more than just surface value. i like
to learn the back story about people and things, their history and
backgrounds. how and why things tick. call me a nerd, but that
stuff fascinates me!","i really have no idea, but generally people and friends have told
me that the first thing they've noticed was my sweet, caring and
kind personality. i know it sounds cheesy, but that's what they've
told me.<br />
<br />
physically, i guess people have mentioned my smile.",too many to name. just ask me.,"1) my family and friends. sure, i don't see them all as much as i'd
like, but they still are the world to me.<br />
<br />
2) dining, food &amp; travel- i love food. i enjoy great food
whether it be at a hole in the wall or at a fancy restaurant, i
like it all as long as it is good. i enjoy adventure and exploring
new places as well. i believe the only way to really get
perspective on things is to experience as much out there as you
can. it gives you a greater appreciation of your life now.<br />
<br />
3) social media/internet/phone - i was a latchkey kid growing up,
so i found refuge in the internet. going places and learning new
things in a matter of a few keystrokes was and still remains a
vital part of my life. i love reading blogs, newspapers and online
journals. helps me stay connected. i am learning to disconnect now
though since i know i probably spend way too much time with
it.<br />
<br />
4) working. i can never become one of those housewives or a
stay-at-home-mom. i know that those two things are hard jobs as
well, but i think i would go out of my mind if i wasn't working. i
love what i do.<br />
<br />
5) sleep. i work pretty hard and often push myself a bit further
than i probably should, but when i am dead tired, believe me when i
tell you i can knock out in a second and i can sleep anywhere and
everywhere and usually do whenever i can get it. i live a pretty on
the go type of life so i love my naps.<br />
<br />
6) music. i absolutely love music. i like almost all kinds as well.
i love it all from going to a show or a concert to listening to the
radio. my current loves musically: yuna, kina grannis, mr. hudson,
frank ocean...",pretty much the same thing most people do.,"either working (i am a night shift worker) or out with friends
seeing a movie or checking out new place to eat or have drinks or
just relaxing at home.","was in a relationship for 14+ years. my last one was for a year.
i'm not good at dating, so i'm not here for that. i'm here to just
make friends to hang out with, etc. not ready to exactly jump on
the horse again.","you are also a kind and caring person.<br />
<br />
message me if you like to go out every now and then and have a good
time but can also enjoy a relaxing night at home as well. i love
food and traveling, so you have to share that passion as well. it
doesn't have to be anything fancy or expensive, i just love new
experiences and adventures since i believe that plays a large part
in how we grow as a person.<br />
<br />
i want to meet someone who is strong and secure in themselves who
doesn't have major issues. sure, we all have a little baggage and
we have have our issues but i am a bit passive at times so i prefer
someone who is a little but of the opposite.<br />
<br />
you also must have a nice job and are not threatened by a woman who
also has the same. by saying nice, i don't necessarily mean
monetary. i want to be with someone who is proud and is passionate
about what they do as i am with my career. i want to be with
someone that i can proudly support and who will do the same for
me.<br />
<br />
do not message me if you're stick skinny. sorry, it's just a
preference. just how some people prefer chocolate over vanilla. i
just happen to not like skinny guys. i am attracted to guys who are
solid with meat on their bones.<br />
<br />
do not message me if you're a weird hipster or too straight laced.
i want a good man, but not too good, i need that little bad boy
streak or as my friends call it, ""edge.""<br />
<br />
overall, message me if you're a normal down to earth person who has
ambition and goals in life and are looking for someone like that as
well."

<br />
i grew up in rochester, ny and went to college in ann arbor, mi
although i have lost all tolerance for the cold during the past six
years of living in the bay area. i lived and worked in costa rica
for a year before coming out here and have a special place in my
heart for central america.<br />
<br />
after working with kids and families during the week, i like to
relax on the weekends. some weekends, i am content to lounge around
and take it easy in the city. i'm learning to play soccer although
i was in over my head on the intermediate team. i also like to get
out of town  wine tasting in sonoma, hikes in pt. reyes and trips
to montara beach to hear live music at la costanera.","i work for a social service agency managing an after school and
family support program for low-income immigrant children. i am
trying to help make the world a more equitable place and to close
the academic achievement gap one small step at a time. i feel
fortunate that i love going to work most days and really believe in
the mission of the agency i work for. i almost always come home
with sand in my shoes and with great stories to tell.","listening<br />

much as i would like. i especially like epic tales such as 100
years of solitude and midnights children, but also enjoy reading
lighter fiction and magazines.<br />
<br />
when it comes to movies, i have a soft spot for 80s movies and
foreign films, but i'll watch just about anything. some favorites
are: the graduate, city of god, back to the future, home for the
holidays, the breakfast club and best in show.<br />
<br />
i don't watch a lot of tv, but liked the wire (although i had to
cover my eyes through a lot of it) and mad men (looking forward to
season 5).<br />
<br />
my taste in music is pretty wide although i'm not so good at
keeping up with the latest bands. i love jazz, especially the
saxophone. afro-cuban all-stars, buena vista social club and the
spanish harlem orchestra are a few of my favorites. i also like
r&amp;b/soul - alicia keys, jill scott, leela james, and more
mellow rock/indie stuff as well. i sing along to pop music (albeit
probably getting the lyrics wrong) on the radio as i am driving to
work.<br />
<br />
some of my favorite foods are: pretzel m&amp;ms, pad thai,
cilantro, avocados, sun dried tomatoes, country sweet sauce (unique
to rochester, ny), grapefruits, and arroz con pollo (costa rican
style).","good friends<br />

"i'm interested in meeting new friends and just checking out this
site as an avenue to meeting new guys in san francisco to make
friends and/or date. i'm an active athletic professional guy who's
interested in meeting the same. i have a good sense of humor and my
hobbies include: travel, family, exercise (jogging, lifting
weights, yoga), art, theater, movies, books (i enjoy reading),

"about me, i'm pretty active. which means throwing marbles with the
boys on the sidewalk, playing jax, and schoolin' foos with my 4
square skills when i'm feeling guuuud. i don't do hop scotch
though, hurts the knees.<br />
<br />
i enjoy kindness, integrity and good calm communication. being
reasonable and balanced is my ultimate aim. (why does that also
sound insane?)<br />
<br />
i tend to be straightforward and honest with how i feel and i live
by that rule. i'd rather hear the blunt honest truth than be strung
along with a lie, yeah. i'd do the same for you.<br />
<br />
i'm attracted to those who can hang with the boys and have
something they cherish in life, whether its a hobby or some other
crazy passion. hangin' out watching movies at home and going for a
walk or two doesn't cut it if that's all you do 90% of the
time.<br />

i cherish exercise, all spicy foods, the golden rule, meeting new
people, and good communication.<br />

meeting new running partners.","just moved into san francisco to experience city life. if i'm out

<br />
i'm guessing something we have in common is that we both think it's
awkward to write about ourselves. so, here's a list of random
factoids instead.<br />
<br />
i pet other people's dogs. all the time.<br />
i really like people who are kind. it's the midwesterner in me.
(i'm from south dakota. yes, people live there!)<br />
brunch is a fantastic weekend invention. yes, i realize every girl
in the city loves brunch. i am no exception.<br />
i'm a doctor, and i feel blessed to have the best job in the world.
hopefully you'll think that's great too.<br />
i have a particularly strong case of wanderlust that leads me all
about the globe every time i get a chance.<br />
i'm super organized but am also a grade-a procrastinator. ah, the
irony.<br />
i have quite possibly the world's worst sense of direction.
fortunately, i enjoy wandering around.<br />
i'd usually rather go out than stay in.<br />
i'll try (most) anything. except for bungee jumping. that just
seems crazy.<br />
i love people who make me think. it doesn't really matter what
about. i just love interesting people. and those who will joust
back with me a bit.<br />
on the outside, i'm a dress-wearing, martini-drinking type of girl.
but don't let that fool you; i'm really more comfortable working in
the developing world.<br />
<br />
i love life. a lot.","i have the greatest job in the world. right now though, i'm taking
some much-needed time off. so now i have time to live life, meet
new people, and travel a bit. couldn't be happier!","filling out online dating profiles*<br />
sarcasm*<br />
<br />
*the above may be related","i'm really happy. and that i have large pupils**.<br />
<br />
**probably unrelated","books - my newly found free time means that i have time to read
again! any suggestions?<br />
<br />
movies - i'd be hard pressed to find a movie better than office
space or nat'l lampoon's christmas vacation.<br />
<br />
shows- how could i watch tv when it's so gorgeous outside all the
time here?<br />
<br />
food - as much as i love all of the fresh, healthy, delicious food
in california, i'm a sucker for a good steak.","my amazing family &amp; wonderful friends. constant
entertainment!<br />
sunshine<br />

animals<br />
mangos &amp; diet coke. breakfast of champions.<br />
optimism. half empty? half full? i'm just happy to have a glass!","international health and my role in it (still figuring that one
out!), reading one of the 30+ books i've stockpiled, where to
travel to next, and what to name my margarita stand if i give it
all up and move to a beach. also, i have to pinch myself all the
time: do i actually get to live here?<br />
<br />
and, how do they build those mini ships inside of bottles? it just
seems really difficult.","back from a quick run, grabbing dinner at one of sf's zillion
awesome hole-in-the-wall places and then out with friends. or maybe
out of town exploring somewhere new!","i'm afraid of fish. i love snorkeling. yeah, i know: weird. too
much shark week as a child.","you're nice, smart, and fun. bonus points if you're adventurous,
charismatic, or like to be outside. and if you ski, like animals,
or to travel? well, that would just be too much."
"dreamer, explorer, observer, lover, runner and seeker (of
experiences, accomplishments and spiritual nourishment). easy going
and laid back yet ambitious and driven. i'm a healthy mix of
optimism and realism. my greatest fear is fear itself, and my
greatest hope is to live a life guided by my personal legend.<br />
<br />
i consider myself a nerd with a penchant for intellectual
stimulation. definitely attracted to the life of the mind, as a
connection makes everything else hotter.<br />

very important to me. ""the obsession with running is really an

gps, going with the flow, math, logic and breaking down a problem

movies - shawshank redemption (isn't this everybody's favorite??),
gone baby gone, memento, the departed, top gun, castaway, pulp
fiction, the hangover, the usual suspects, and fight club.<br />
<br />
shows - i'm not a big tv guy. its a conscious decision to miss out
on so much pop culture. that said, admittedly, i have a special
place in my heart for entourage, californication, dexter and top
gear.<br />
<br />
music - my first love is alternative and 90's hip hop - pink floyd,
ac/dc, nirvana, soundgarden, audioslave, u2, radiohead, coldplay,
the black keys, dr. dre, snoop, 2pac, notorious, kanye, lil wayne,
jay z, and the list goes on. right now noah and the whale is on

"it's long, i know, but worth the read i think....who am i, what do
i want? those are pretty deep questions for a saturday morning and
i'm not sure i have the answers. even if i think i know the
answers, one thing i'm sure of, who i am and what i want is never
set in stone. those answers continue to evolve; which i'm sure is a
good thing. having said that...i know for sure that i'm a gay white
male living in sf for the past 26 years and self-employed in a
profession that i really enjoy. being creative and getting paid for
it is pretty cool. i like where i live and usually love the people
that surround me, sometimes not, you know we all have our moods. i
also know that i'd like to meet a decent, honest, caring and
passionate guy that i can count on to ride with me through this
crazy world. generally speaking though, you'll probably find me to
be a very easy going, fun guy with a lot of interests, very honest,
a lot of passion and a really good heart and soul. i'm a pretty
playful guy, i like men who can be boyish in that way, knowing when
to be serious and when to let loose and have fun being a kid. i
tend to be attracted to guys who are more on the active side in and
out of the sack, guys who are comfortable hiking, biking, being in
the ocean, basically moving your body, not interested in couch
dwellers. in addition, emotionally available guys are where it's at
for me. if you can communicate with me, that's a big plus, we're
half way there. i'm not into drama, save it for the stage. like
everyone, i have my faults and i'll be the first to admit
it...perfection is completely overrated. i'm authentic and real and
understanding, but i do have a very low tolerance for people who
aren't. physically, emotionally and spiritually, i take care of
myself and invest time and energy into those parts of myself and
i'm drawn to people who do the same. i like to be active, but not
scheduled out, i need my down time. i enjoy being outdoors and
being social but also like to hang out alone at home or just take a
walk on the beach by myself to recharge. i get a lot of comfort and
pleasure from the ocean. when i surf, i find it so amazing to be in
the water, surrounded by sea life and viewing the coast from out
there. riding a wave is an incredible feeling, being powered by
nature and feeling so in sync with life, so much a part of nature.
that's my deeper side talking.<br />
most of my friends have been with me for years, some as long as
grade school. i'm really loyal that way. it's very comforting to
have a long history with people, helps to ground me.<br />
my family is really cool and wants to see me with a nice guy that
they can embarrass me in front of. isn't that what families are
for, to remind us of where we came from and how far we've
evolved...hopefully. my mom is really great, she's 83 and is so
active, doing yoga and aerobics, taking trips, drinking boxed wine
with friends, volunteering, keeping the family together and
drinking more boxed wine with friends. we're big fans of each
other. i have a large extended family, aunts, uncles, cousins and
we get together usually once a year at thanksgiving. they always
get excited when i bring a new guy around. you know the gay
relative with a new boyfriend is a novelty in most families. i
think it makes them feel hip and cool and that works for me.<br />
on the serious side, i'm hiv- if that matters to you one way or the
other.<br />
well enough about me. i hope i've given you some insight into who i
am and the type of man i'm looking to meet; besides, i'm tired of
writing about myself. so if you're interested let me know, give me
a wink or whatever the hell it is they do on this site to
communicate an interest.<br />

just love going underwater to admire the marine flora and fauna, to
allow the current drift me through a kaleidoscope of corals and
fishes, and be immersed by such natural beauty.<br />
<br />
i use to live in singapore and have been living in the bay area for
over 3 years. i joined okcupid to meet new girls and hopefully
settle down on a long term relationship. other than that, i am
pretty contented with most aspects of my life. i love my work, have
a supportive family, have sufficient leisure time, and enjoy at
least 2 vacations a year.","i am a professional game developer and is currently working on an
epic mmorpg title. i make and play games for a living. but please,
don't assume i'm a nerd or a couch potato because of that.<br />
<br />
anyway, i participate in a huge variety of activities. most of my
weeknights are spent playing the piano, reading, watching movies
and drama on netflix, watching asian drama, playing bridge at a
bridge club, dancing (i took up argentine tango, salsa, swing, and
other dances) and playing computer games. my weekends are usually
spent outdoors. i play tennis, jog, hike (i've hiked in most of the
state/county parks in the bay area and santa cruz), and
occasionally do scuba diving at monterey.","contract bridge, chess and intellectual games in general.<br />

reich, a history of israel: from the rise of zionism to our time, a
people's history of the united states.<br />
<br />
i frequently go to the theaters, like once a week. since the people
i go to the movies with are usually guys, the genres i most often
watch are thriller, action, blockbuster, comedy, sci-fi and drama.

i really enjoy being active outside, riding my bike, etc. it's a
good balance since my day job is pretty sedentary. i play video

caring, kind hearted, soft, loving, warm, tender and gentle man. im
also very true, honest and hardworking man as well. i am one of the
most fantastic people in this world (yes im proud to say that)

sick. i have a warm smile and a mediterranean look. i try to be
handsome inside and out. i am independent and can care for myself,
but i believe life is more fun when you have someone to share it
with. life doesn't get any better than this. i've discovered the
secret to a happy and fulfilling life, i believe in everything in
moderation. i believe there's a time to play, and a time to work. i
recycle, volunteer, give blood and sincerely believe that we can
all make a difference. life is too short to be getting yourself
involved in drama all the time so i try to set myself loose and
have as much fun as i can. i'm a true romantic at heart, a

i am principled, honest, and inquisitive","for work, i am a researcher for a pharmaceutical company in the bay
area. its rewarding work, that i know will help make the lives of
many people better one day.<br />
<br />
i'm an uncle of 3 awesome nieces and try to be the best one i can.
they are the reason i moved to california about 5 years ago and
moved across country so i can be close to them. to show(not just
tell) that i will be there when they need me. i grew up in a family
where i knew i could count on my uncles and aunts for anything, i
wanted to give that to them.<br />
<br />
i work out a lot(typically 4 to 5 times a week). it helps provide
balance in my life. i'm lucky enough to live near a gym that has a
pool so i get to go swim.<br />
<br />
i grew up on a subtropical island and go back as often as i can to
visit my family and teacher.","oh boy... self promotion is not my strong suit(no, i'm not
exceptionally shy or anything, i dislike feeling like i am
bragging) but humility doesn't seem to work here, so here
goes.<br />
<a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=science"">science</a>, i have
always been good at figuring out problems and understanding how
things work. i was that kid that disassembled everything that i
could get my hands on, and usually able to get it back together in
working order.... most of the time. (sorry about that radio ojii...
hey, i was 6).<br />
*i just came back from a large bio-tech conference in san
francisco, i was the only attendee that solved a 3-d spatial
relation/causality <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=puzzle"">puzzle</a> out of all that tried. i won the
puzzle as the prize.<br />
<br />
i'm patient and i am good at listening to people and relating to
them.<br />
<br />
learning new things. i'm a jack of all trades, its easy for me to
pick up new skills and learn, and get pretty decent fast.","i would guess that its usually my sense of humor, i find a lot of
things funny.<br />
also that i'm not all white, i'm half (uchinaanchu means okinawan
in uchinaa hougen).<br />
i'm pretty broad for my height.","books: i typically like <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=science+fiction"">science fiction</a>, and fantasy
books(tolkien, h. potter series, select books from the gw black
library).<br />
movies: there's so many i like! the twilight samurai, kung-fu
hustle, spirited away, howl's moving castle(pretty much anything by
miyazaki) just to name a few.<br />
<br />
music: i'm pretty open musically, if i have to pick favorite genres
it would be classical (and hard rock/metal) i can't think of a
genre that i haven't listened to and enjoyed some aspect of it.
from bluegrass, to techno i can find something to like in it
all.<br />
generally though, i'm a k-fog and npr kinda guy when it comes to
listening to the radio.<br />
<br />
food: my favorite cuisine is by far japanese food. followed closely
by indian, and just about anything else that's tasty or put in
front of me(i'll pretty much try most things to see if i like it).","my family, and friends. all others are either necessities of life,
or details in the mix.","... recently it seems to be about ""i spend a lot of time thinking
about...."" :)<br />
<br />
ok, what i do spend time pondering is what i want to do next(new
hobbies etc) career move, etc. my true calling, i'm a scientist by
training but i can't help but feel there's something else out there
for me that's more suited to my personality and interests.<br />
<br />
etymology, for some reason i find it fascinating(not that i know a
lot about it though).<br />
<br />
i also think a lot about the causality of actions that people
take(myself included) both on a individual scale and
group/social(culture) dynamics. i like to understand why people do
certain things.<br />
<br />
when my next trip back to japan will be.","usually hanging out with friends: either playing some games,
watching a movie. at the gym, or out for a ride on my bike.","well... yeah.. ok.<br />
<br />
i'm here on okcupid to meet new people, make new friends and
perhaps meet someone special i can share myself with.<br />

to try it out.","you would like to get to know me.<br />
<br />
please be honest and up front, i appreciate acknowledgment and
responses back.<br />
<br />
*i am not looking for a fling of some sort, please don't approach
me for such.*"
"who am i? well, on the one hand i'm your typical guy. i like beer,
pizza, cars, sports, and generally being a dude. on the flip side,
i think that love actually is the best movie of the 2000s (ridicule
all you want, but (1) it was a great movie, and (2) it was a
terrible decade for movies).<br />
<br />
i'm going to be genuinely interested in anything you are passionate
about. there's no better way to get to know you than let you talk
about what you love. and if you love it, it will be fun listening
to you talk about it. now, if what you choose to talk about are the
49ers, georgetown or chicago bulls basketball i might just have to
marry you on the spot.<br />
<br />
i just graduated from law school (now a summer of bar prep,
joy...), and i'm actually one of those sick people who enjoyed law
school. finals were terrible, but learning is fun. yes, i said that
and i believe it. we can be friends if you disagree, but i don't
know if we can be more.<br />
<br />
a few other generally specific things: best movie - casablanca;
best book - the republic (followed up by either ender's game or
gates of fire (the movie that 300 should have been!)); best cd (ok,
i know no one buys full cds anymore, but it's the best way to
describe ""best collection of songs"") - ccr's chronicles; best tv
show - studio 60 (in spurts) or west wing (until zoe got kidnapped
('cause that's when sorkin stopped writing it)); best sports team -
1991 chicago bulls (no one beats michael that year) - best
punctuation is apparently (parenthesis).<br />
<br />
i've been told that i have an opinion on everything, and that's
probably true. that said, i'll listen to your side of the
discussion on just about anything.<br />
<br />
oh, and i laugh at everything. it's not that i'm not taking you
seriously, i just can't stop being glibly wry and sarcastic.","recently graduated law student and now doing my best to actually
learn everything i was supposed to be taught while in school so i
can pass the bar. from there it's find legitimate employment and
hopefully have a real answer to this question.<br />
<br />
on a less pragmatic, more philosophical note i'm working on the
whole ""live an examined life"" thing. it's working for me in that my
life is <strong>very</strong> examined... whether that's a good
thing or not varies from day to day.<br />
<br />
and occasionally day dreaming about winning the lottery and just
teaching high school history and philosophy, 'cause there's nothing
that 13-18 year old kids would enjoy more than listening to me talk
about plato!","finding the humor in any situation.<br />
<br />
also, since basic grammar knowledge gets regularly called out, this
is my <em>silly</em> attempt to prove i can do there, their,
they're, to, too and two: there are two types of people in the
world: those who don't know that using ""myself"" is almost always
wrong and those who know it's a reflexive pronoun. of the two, the
former are too stupid to stomach because their pretentious
ignorance makes them sound incredibly obnoxious. ultimately,
they're going to get their comeuppance. additionally, whether to
use ""and me"" or ""and i"" generally falls into this category. the
easy check? just take the ""and"" out of the sentence and see which
sounds better. i promise, it works.<br />
<br />
also, i'm apparently quite good at marking okc's questions as
irrelevant, as the system just hollered at me for not marking
enough questions as important. i'm not sure what that means, but it
must mean something. probably that a lot of the questions are
repetitive, unimportant and/or (a construction you're never
supposed to use, i'm an intentional non-conformist at times) silly.","honestly, who can say. i'm on my side not theirs, so i don't know
what they notice about me. wow, i've read that so many times, and
it annoys me each time. ok, legit answer follows:<br />
<br />
based on the fact that you're still reading and all you've seen are
some pictures and read some words, then i'd guess the first thing
people notice is either my (not totally hideous) appearance, or an
appreciation of my (amazingly stellar) personality as it comes
through via the written word. i'm also actually as tall as i say i
am, so the fact that you still have to look up at me while wearing
heels might also happen.<br />
<br />
ya, that's what we'll go with for this one.","um, i covered books, movies, shows, and music above. i've got way
more answers on books, movies and tv, so if you're interested let
me know and i'll regale you with a laundry list of great answers.
as for music, i know what i like when i listen to it and am fairly
eclectic in my likes, but i'll be the first to admit that music is
background more than foreground in my life. that said, i'll happily
tag along (and sing poorly to songs i don't know) to any concert
that's offered up.<br />
<br />
food-wise, i live on pizza, although since moving back to sf from
the east coast i'll admit that tacos are coming into serious
contention for most consumed.","pizza<br />
diet coke (i'm addicted, but then, i don't drink coffee and a
person needs their caffeine, right?) (and this is apparently the #1
most frequent word in all white people's okc profiles, so i guess
i'm just doing my part)<br />
can i say books generally or do i have to give one
specifically?<br />
um, after those 3 i'd mostly be good. there's a ton of things i'd
be really pissed to lose out on, but those three i really would
struggle to function without.","this site really wants to get inside my head doesn't it? it's kinda
scary in there. a rough smattering - legal things (sorry, it
becomes all consuming), nfl - particularly the niners (and the fact
that i kept a negative message about them going all season 'cause
they were playing well under it and i was clearly influencing that
positive play). and then, mostly because i can't help myself, i
actually do think deep thoughts about the social and political
structure of our world.<br />
<br />
trust me, it's a lot more interesting of an internal conversation
than you'd think.<br />
<br />
(also cracking up about the fact that i'm apparently a lot more
arrogant - um, ok, if you say so okc - and less well mannered -
this one i'd actually take issue with, but i guess you'll just have
to take my word on that - although i do like putting my elbows on
the table at dinner, it's more comfortable. and the fact that i'm
apparently that much more energetic than most people is a really
frightening comment about how lazy most people must be.)","if i'm not in hermit mode then i'm grabbing food with friends at a
semi raucous locale where the people watching is as good as the
food, followed up by however much debauchery we can collectively
convince each other to partake in. if i'm in hermit mode, then
netflix instant is my savior.","well, i have the regulation number of body parts, and as far as i
can tell they're all in working order so i can't pull something
easy out like i have a 3rd nipple. if you've really made it this
far, i guess the revelation that i'm a closeted nerd a) won't come
as a huge surprise and b) won't prevent you from reading just one
more of these little boxes.<br />
<br />
and when i'm really bored i'm both narcissistic and introspective
enough to really enjoy going through the okc questions and
providing explained answers. seriously, i have wayyyy too many
answered questions. it's getting to be a problem.","you've read this far and are still interested. i've tried to put
the real me in here as much as possible, so what you see and read
is what you're gonna get.<br />
<br />
or you could have just been floored by the pictures i guess
(stranger things have happened), and if that's the case, skip
reading my mini-essay and fire off a message.<br />

octavia butler and enjoy rita mae brown mysteries. i just
discovered christopher moore who is definitely a hoot! my favorite
movie of all time is a toss between: the cook, the thief, his wife,
and her lover and an affair to remember. i really love bbs shows
especially the comedies: are you being served, as time goes by, and
of course monty python! recently just got into their mysteries:
wake the dead, being human, life on mars (much better than the
american version) and state of play (again much better than the

and days on the green concerts in oakland. five top bands for under
$20.00! best concert i ever saw, the clash open for the who's first

i moved to san francisco in 2005 from san diego, got rid of my car
and got my motorcycle license. i enjoy stumbling into every bar in
the city almost as much as enjoy cooking dinner at home, opening a
bottle of wine and watching a movie.<br />
<br />
i know everyone loves to travel but i've really made it a point to
make at least one big trip every year or 2. i spent a month in
australia &amp; new zealand a few years ago and loved it! i'm
planning on south africa or morocco this year or next.<br />
<br />
i can't function during the day until i've had my cup of coffee. i
really enjoy the simple things- i'll take a sloppy kiss over a
fancy dinner any day- scratch that, you can take me to dinner too.","i recently started my own events planning company, slowly but
surely building it from the ground up. it has been both the most
exciting and terrifying experience in my life but i can honestly

my life i also work for a big fancy corporate company as an
executive manager which i also happen to love. plus my office view
is the ferry building so i really can't complain.<br />

in my spare time i like to do anything that keeps my creativity
going and my mind active. i have to be outside as often as

up","catch phrase, dancing, painting / drawing, swimming, wakeboarding,
holding my liquor, being type-a organized, changing things up,
cooking, making homemade sangria, planning trips, making people
laugh, being the beat boss anyone could ask for, defusing

pushing myself and making a a fool of myself among other things.","i still wear a watch, tattoos, my smile- i've got a killer dentist

<br />
movies: i can be a total sci-fi nerd when it comes to movies but
i'd be lying if i said my shelves aren't pack with cheesy romantic
comedies as well. otherwise, fear, momento, rushmore, forest gump,
gangs of new york, cashback, naked gun, inception, amelie, hanna,

pretending to enjoy my ""breathtaking voice"".<br />

me. i am all about humor! you have to be funny and easy going like
i feel i am. i am a very relaxed person and it takes a lot to piss
me off. i have lived all over the states including south korea to
teach english. i am in love with the outdoors and extreme sports.
this is the first time i have ever lived in a huge city and really
away from snow. i love winter and snow, but wanted to step out of
my comfort zone. i need honesty and adventure in my life. i love
relaxing and lounging around the house. i love going out and
checking out the night life scene and music scene. i rock climb,
ice climb, scuba dive, sky dive, snow ski, water ski, snow shoe,
dance, sing, draw, paint, cook, hike, camp, travel, four wheel,
cuddle, party, relax, stay fit, meditate, and etc. the list goes
on. i really enjoy being challenged or just relaxing. one of my
favorite things is to get in my car, drive to a spot where i can
watch the sunset and star's, listen to powerful music and just let
my mind travel. i am a very spiritual person, but am still in
search of what works for me. i do love my life and what surrounds
it!","just moved to san fran from jackson hole, wy, before that was
durango, co. i am in the self discovery stage of life. i am
currently looking into moving abroad next year to australia for one
year than 3 months in new zealand for their winter, then travel for
one year to thailand, nepal, india, and africa( hoping to climb mt.
kilimanjaro.) i am open to almost anything, but i am cautious of
who or what i let in my life. it needs to benefit me somehow and i
need to benefit it! i am in search of a career that involves the
outdoor world/travel. i am always trying to do something different
every weekend. my weekends are spent outdoors climbing, learning to
surf, exploring, or just hanging out with friends. i am wanting to
take some outdoor adventure film classes so i can further my
passion. i am finding my way of life! i am finally learning how to
play the guitar!!!!!!","how do you actually answer this question. eating ice cream and
riding a bike at the same time. jumping off a big cliff skiing,
thinking, ""holy cow that jump must have been 30 feet high"" when
really it was only a 5 in cliff! there is so much that makes a
person. making people laugh. i feel that i am really good at
skiing, adventure, travel, loving, honesty, singing, learning,
friendship, cooking, oh man the list goes on. i like anything. but
snow skiing and loving is what i am best at!","my height, the way i carry myself, my hair, green eyes, and my
sense of humor","i can't narrow these questions down, i really like them all but i
would have to say i love anything that deals with travel, history,
extreme sports, art. i am fascinated with documentaries.<br />
i love all types of food, and trying new foods. i hate clam
chowder. i love all music except hip hop some r&amp;b and

playground at night( ok that happened once ), camping, concerts,
pubs, fun at home dinner with friends, twister, whatever cuz the

"fun, happy, yet like to embrace my emotional side and have a good
cry sometimes. i'm having a great time this go around in life. i
appreciate simple goofy fun. take care of myself.<br />
workout, enjoy cooking, painting my toenails, and then running
through the neighborhood in a bright orange kimono with no pants
on. i love to climb the telephone poles in far away places and snip
their wires.<br />

"it's hard to summarize myself in such a limited space...but here
goes:<br />
i'm a stable, confident, warm, kind, generous, even-tempered single
guy...kinda vanilla and boring...right? however, once you get to
know me, you'll soon see that i have a kinky quirky side and am a
lot of fun. i have a dry, sarcastic sense of humor and love to
laugh. since i've been single, i've enjoyed exploring and expanding
my sensual and sexual life, and i'm not done yet. i'm pretty much
up for anything at anytime.....(well....at least once).<br />
<br />
so what am i looking for?<br />
i'm looking for friendship, intimacy, companionship, love, and
whatever comes around....in whatever order they fall. i'm an
adventurous lover, and really enjoy sex.....i tend to take control
in the bedroom (if we actually end up in the bedroom), and really
enjoy pleasing my partner(s). i can't tell you how much i enjoy
that first kiss and the zing of that chemical connection with a new
partner.<br />
<br />
i've been in both monogamous and non-monogamous relationships, and
am really comfortable in both.<br />
<br />
right now i'm looking for casual relationships/friendships that may
or may not turn into short or long-term relationships. i'm open to
the possibilty of a longer-term relationship, but absolutely not
obsessed or limited to looking for one.<br />
<br />
while i'm comfortable with multiple relationships, i don't know if
i would go so far as saying that i have a poly outlook on life. i'm
certainly open to it, and will simply have to see if it's for
me.<br />
<br />
i have two great kids (13 and 11) who are the greatest joy in my
life. they are a priority in my life, and take a good portion of my
time. i share custody with their mother, but have them roughly half
of the time.<br />
<br />
i appreciate intelligent women, and enjoy fast-paced
random-knowledge converstations. i fully appreciate that
personality and chemistry are important for relationships, and a
strong mind and personality are a huge turn-on for me.<br />
<br />
i'm attracted to all body sizes and shapes. but for a woman to hold
my interest, she needs to be extremely comfortable with herself and
her body.<br />
<br />
a few additional random things about me:<br />
i love the spirit, and energy of sf....i've worked in the city, but
could never live there. i'm a confirmed ""suburbanite.<br />
<br />
i would rather go to a neighborhood dive bar than wait in line for
the hottest nightclub in town.<br />
<br />
i love exploring new restaurants and new foods, but if i had to
choose a last meal......it would be breakfast at my favorite diner
with friends.","i usually work in the fields of facility management and logistics.
although, recently during a spell of introspection, i realized that
i was very unhappy with what i was doing. fortunately, i am in a
position to take the opportunity to reevaluate my priorities and
find something that i really want to do.<br />
<br />
i volunteer a lot of time at my kid's school, which allows me to be
more involved in their lives. i'm also a youth coach, having
coached my kids teams (soccer and baseball) for the past 6 years. i
really enjoy seeing my players inprove not only their skills but
their overall understanding and appreciation of the sport.","thinking things through logically, i like to know how things work
or how systems operate...but i don't obsess about it.<br />
<br />
i've been told that i'm good a connecting with people, and putting
them at ease. i'm a really good coach and mentor to kids.","well let's see....my heght (6'2"") and my mostly white hair (hard to
believe that at 44 i have gone almost completely white).","i enjoy trying new restaurants and new types of food. i'm a fairly
adventurous foodie....enjoy the new experiences and trying new
things with friends.<br />
<br />
i am a voracious reader....mostly action/sci fi/mystery thillers. i
read whenever i can, usually have a couple of books going at one
time. i'm not really into the ""examine my existential bellybutton""
type of books, but rather either historical or action-packed
ones.<br />
<br />
i enjoy all types of music...in my ipod are tons of hits from the
70's and 80's (mostly).....anything from al green to metallica to
hank williams, jr. depending on my mood at the moment, i'll listen
to just about anything. i enjoy live music....anything from
intimate cafes to stadium shows.<br />
<br />
favorite tv shows....daily show (i think i have a man-crush on jon
stewart), colbert report, chelsey lately, top gear (bbc version),
tosh.0, person of interest, californication, house of lies, dexter,
spartacus, burn notice, etc. i do watch sports, but not
obsessively.<br />

conversation into something absurd with someone equally silly -
with a straight face. it's no coincidence that magritte is one of
my favourite artists.<br />
<br />
i'm endlessly reflective, about absolutely everything - i think
it's the only way anyone gets insight into themselves and the

"i'm many things. was born in sf but lived in mexico for 4 years
when i was a child. i'm a child of a liberal activist so i had sort
of an unconventional upbringing traveling around latin america on
solidarity brigades. i have gone to live in senegal and ghana for
five months each and these were some of the most interesting
experiences of my life. africa has taught me so much about how to
live, share, be joyful and soulful. i love culture. i am a dancer.
i am a critical thinker who's always looking to try and understand
what' going on around me. i looove music. started dancing cuban
salsa when i was 16 but now i listen to a lot of caribbean and
african music such as reggae, dancehall, zouk, coupe decale,

offers me to all of bay area. there is a lot that the city offers
and i like to take advantage of that. i have a good group of
friends all over the city and the bay area. we like going to beer
festivals and microbrews and there are plenty in the area. some of
us are into wine tasting and a trip to napa also ends up happening
every once in a while.<br />
i am into snowboarding and like to go up to tahoe as often as i
can. we have a house in the south lake tahoe area that comes in
handy when we go as a group.<br />
i am also into running and run with the san francisco road runners
club. it's a great group of people and i run and train with them
three times a week. i have also started getting into more extreme
athletic events like the tough mudder and go ruck challenge. its a
lot of fun and the camaderie it helps build with fellow runners is
amazing!<br />
i also like exploring the city for restaurants offering different
cuisines and try to find a new one as often as i can. meeting
people that come from a different background than mine is something
i treasure. it helps me see the world from an entirely different
perspective and broadens my horizons.<br />

"i am a california native living and working in san francisco - so
much of my time is spent in or around the city. live music is a
favorite for me and i am easy to please! i enjoy rock, reggae,
indy, hip hop, country, metal, 80s, classic rock, and some
electronica here and there. my personal interests span a wide
spectrum of activities including snowboarding, camping, hiking,
lifting weights, studio art, playing / watching sports (go giants,
sharks, and errrr... niners!), shooting sports, riding motorcycles,
fishing / hunting, movies, reading, and socratic
philosophizing.<br />
<br />
tahoe is my bi-seasonal paradise - i spend a good amount of time
there during the summer/winter and i always buy a season pass to
feed my snowboarding addiction (catch me on the north &amp; west
shores). i have no friends on a pow day, or at least no friends
until lunch time and the best snow is tracked out - so if you can't
keep up we can ski together after lunch! i love camping and the
outdoors have always drawn me towards them. getting out there is
always in the back of my mind!<br />

around the house. any excuse to use power tools!","i am a college grad working for a saas technology company in san

i'm not in school right now. i'm in a sort of in an in between

next year. in the meantime, i make ice cream (yes, for a living), i
kick around with a few select ridiculous people, and i try to

some things i'm bad at to even the scales:<br />
<br />
speaking spanish, or any other language for that matter, things
that require grace and balance, being quiet, drawing/illustration,
forgetting people, keeping plants alive.<br />
<br />
also! i cannot ride a bike or drive a car in the slightest. if you
are someone who is really awesome to the point of being able to
instruct, and are local, you should teach me! same goes with
languages and sign language. i've been told that i'm cute when i'm
trying to learn something new ;)","well i just dyed the everloving shit out of my hair (think cherry
lollipop) so that's a cheat into getting instant attention. as a
person, fuck if i know. i've been told that i have a certain
bluntness and confidence that is noticeable. some people say my
smile and my glasses. a lot of people also say my tits, let's just
be honest here. you tell me.<br />
<br />
i'm at a pretty good point in regards to how i feel about my body.
i should throw it out there that i am not a smooth skinny person. i
am not delicate. i never have been, i don't ever want to be. i
think my standpoint nowadays is realizing that my body allows me to
do so many amazing things in the world that it is unfair to harbor
bad feelings about it because it's not perfect. i like my squish
and i'm never going to give up my foodlove.","books<br />

don't like sweets a little. i can and sometimes do eat ice cream
daily. i eat mostly everything. big faves: indian, thai, sushi,
spanish, caribbean, mediterranean, new american swank, pizza,
breakfast, burgers, and bacon. and i make fabulous brunch dishes.

"i love spontaneity and synchronicity. i think i am a mermaid as i
love to be in water. what makes my soul light up and makes me
smile; kindness, dogs, kids, what i see through my camera, birds,

art/technology fun things too!<br />

gardening. socializing with any culture or age group. playing in

even have to start with s!<br />
<br />
i hug trees, stop for conversations with animals and their people
and am compassionate to a fault. i'm insatiably curious. i cherish
expansive time for long conversations that meander through myriad
meaningful topics, have little interest in following what's
currently popular and have far more questions than answers (and,
like rilke, am seeking to love the questions themselves). i
continue to let go of ""things"" and simplify my life.<br />

i will reach out with affection and touch to everyone and look
forward to cuddling up with my someone at the end of a day.<br />
<br />
i find intelligence, confidence, humor, kindness, and generosity
incredibly sexy in a man. i'm looking for someone who wants to
travel with me (i've lived overseas and have a very international
perspective), laugh with me, learn with me, someone who wants to
share their thoughts and their heart, a man who's learned, through
the struggles and wounds we all suffer in life, to consciously care
for himself, offering that care in partnership as well. i'm seeking
someone else enchanted with the wonder of life.<br />

musical volunteers and develop a program at a major medical center,

this amazing city (the roller coaster of hills and
valleys...embellished eclectic victorian architecture...and the
fog, i confess i love the fog). i also need regular journeys into
the quiet of nature. i love discovering new things in both
places.<br />
<br />
i truly believe it's never too late to have a happy childhood...or
great dating experiences. i look forward to exchanging notes, phone
calls (i love the mystery of meeting a voice before the whole
person), then getting together at some mutually agreed on place for
tea, a walk, a ferry ride, so much to explore.<br />
<br />
and this intrepid online dating explorer is hoping you (yes,
you...the amazing guy reading this right now) might just be my
special someone, because i also believe it's never too late to find
a great love, friendship caught on fire, a co-creator for lessons
in this life class you cannot complete alone.","i'm beginning new projects in work, amazed by the tenaciousness of

"i am very independent both in what i do and what i think (which is
my euphemistic way of saying that i can be a little quirky). i can
also be very intense, goal oriented, and type a (when i'm not
diligently procrastinating).<br />
<br />
i enjoy being around people who have strong personalities and ideas
of their own. when i am with my friends, i like to laugh a lot, and
talk about trivial stuff, unless we're talking about serious stuff,
which we do too. i have to say that i have an irreverent sense of
humor, so if i did not hold my tongue, i would be pretty adept at
offending respectable people.<br />

learned long ago. i am driven to analyze and discover the inner

now, and why tee tee smells funny when you eat asparagus.","going out with friends from work, taking myself out to dinner at a

"i moved to san francisco for an internship last january from boston
to finish up my degree. currently working my dream job as a
physical therapist at a clinic downtown and i couldn't be
happier.<br />
<br />
i would consider myself to be pretty spontaneous, i hate planning
things ahead of time.<br />
<br />
i also like soup, sandwiches, sake, soju, san francisco..hmm
basically anything that starts with the letter s.","working full time as a physical therapist, and training part time
as an amateur boxer, although sometimes wishing i could be one of
those professional gamers that get to play and get paid to play
video games for 10-12 hours a day, talk about living the dream eh?!
anyway i enjoy what i do, i treat all sorts of different injuries
everyday, while mutilating myself in the boxing gym at night, irony
at its finest, eh?","boxing, kick-boxing, wrestling, anatomy (well i guess i can't be
""good"" at anatomy, but i do know much about it), and i also have a
really, really, good memory, not quite photographic but still
pretty darn good.<br />
<br />
things i'm not good at: following directions, reading maps, talking
on the phone, making plans ahead of time (i'd rather just wing it)","my filipino appearance, even though i am not filipino (i am chinese
actually). no offense to you pinoy girls, but i do find it sort of
amusing how the first line out of most people i meet comes in the
form of, ""you're filipino, right? what? you're not? thats crazy!""","i don't always read books, but when i do, i prefer dos equis.<br />
shows? how i met your mother, breaking bad, cowboy bebop, rurouni
kenshin, samurai champloo, the walking dead, and just about any
japanese anime that includes swords and/or ninjas<br />
food? bacon wrapped hot-dogs, chicken pho, vietnamese style
pork-chops and rice with an egg on top!<br />
music? i'll listen to anything except country.","my boxing gear - especially the headgear and the mouthpiece,
protect yourself at all times!<br />

fashion and comfort rolled into one<br />

been told i have a questionable taste in music)<br />

<br />

rice<br />
<br />
computer","my job, the patients that i treat and how i am going to make them
better. improving myself as a professional, gaining knowledge and
learning everyday...it's quite satisfying!<br />
<br />
but when i'm not working, i tend to drift off, and seemingly stare
at nothing for a minute or so, almost as if i'm in some sort of
deep thought or state of confusion, but in reality i'm probably
just thinking about food or something tasty.<br />
<br />
what the world is going to be like in twenty years when google
becomes evil and the machines take over. i wonder if it'll be more
matrixy or terminator-esque.","hanging out with friends, happy hours, drinking, dancing,
karaoke'ing. usually followed by hauling my dehydrated, hungover
corpse into the gym for muay thai and boxing training on saturday
mornings.","lady gaga - bad romance, ever see the music video? fill me up with
enough beer and liquor and you may get to see the entire dance
choreography, in its entirety if we just so happen to hear it at a

"hi! i'm that girl who talks to people and dogs on the street, who
is outgoing, generally curious about life and people, smiles a lot,
and appreciates a sense of humor and a healthy bit of east coast
snark:) something like: you can take the girl out of new york, but
you can't take new york out of the girl(so, yes, i am from new
york, but try not to hold that against me) currently, i'm
virtually bi-costal between san francisco, boston, and new york,
though living most of the time in san francisco. i also travel to
europe twice a year for business, and, of course, love to travel
for pleasure both here and abroad. i love being in new and
undiscovered places, and exploring what's there. i also have a few
very special specific places i return to over and over, which are
very near and dear to me. i'd love to bring someone i care about to
all of those places with me.<br />
<br />
i'm perfectly comfortable going into a crowded place not knowing
anyone and can begin a conversation about pretty much anything. in
fact i actually like it. i'm curious about people, who they are,
and what makes them tick. i'm always intrigued by where different
people came from, what they do, and what they think. my friends
would say that i'm genuine, generous, and loyal, which is important
to me. (my dog would say that i'm pretty fun to be around most of
the time, but i'm pretty sure he is a bit biased especially on the
2 dog park days)<br />
<br />
i'm happy to say that i'm in a good place right now. i own a small
business, and it's on the upswing, which is satisfying. i'm stable
with who i am, i am extremely grounded; i know what i want, and am
clear on the things that make me happy and bring me back to my
center. sometimes my life is a bit crazy, which brings with it a
certain energy and excitement. but i also spend a lot of quiet time
doing nothing; sitting in caf's or at the park with my dog, or on
the couch reading. in the multitasking world we live in, i
sometimes challenge myself to do one thing at a time. it doesn't
always happen, but i'm consistently trying this. it's nice
sometimes to just listen to music and do nothing else, or lay on
the couch and look out the window at the trees, and that's it. i
can be engaging and intense, passionate and curious, quiet and
contemplative, and silly and fun. all of that is me. (not
necessarily all at the same time, though), and i'd like to share
all of it.<br />
<br />
my likes range from classical to kfog, picasso to photography (i'm
an avid photographer). yoga, hiking, and biking (completed my first
century round lake tahoe) and tennis are my preferred outdoor
activities. although it would be nice to have similar interests, i
don't think you have to share all of those. what's important to me
is that you know who you are, and what makes you tick and you are
open to letting someone into your life. ultimately, it's about
fitting into each other's lives easily, feeling as if you have
known someone all your life even if you haven't, and having the
willingness and courage to explore all sides of someone, all with
the ups and downs, that iswell.life. i do want to have a family
and i am open to all possibilities in that realm.<br />
<br />
to sum this up, let's just say that your life with me won't be
boring, but i'm also pretty regular in many ways. basically, i'm
""the girl next door"" with some creative twists, and a lot of
eclectic interests. (and i will definitely laugh at even your
silliest jokes:)","i'm running my business, spending time with family and friends, and
traveling a lot. i'm passionate about beautiful art, beautiful
places, and yoga. but, as i said above, i'm also very happy to
snuggle on my couch watching something on tv, or listening to some
beautiful music (with you) and my dog nearby. i also like doing a
lot of sporty and artsy things:) i'm one of those people who really
likes exercising. i need to be active.","connecting people and making connections. i'm creative, and love
putting strange stuff together weather it be in a photograph or in
my apartment.","my smile, and that i'm very friendly and outgoing","nonfiction; biographies, historical nonfiction, and compelling
fiction. and, oki'm admitting it herei'm also basically a
magazine junkiebusiness, design, yoga mags. but, i really really
love inc and fast company. i'm kind of an entrepreneur/business
junkie in that way.<br />
<br />
musically, i'm very into classical and listen to it a lot, but i'm
equally tuned into kfog in the car.<br />
<br />
food-wise, i just returned from italy, and every time i'm there,
i'm constantly amazed that food can be that good. it's really about
simple, great, fresh, high quality ingredients. i enjoy cooking and
eating healthy, and exploring new restaurants and recipes.","a comfy place to live<br />
family<br />
my dog<br />
friends<br />
fresh food<br />
sunshine<br />
yoga (ok, that's 7, but i really can't do without yoga:)","what makes people tick; what my dog is thinking; solutions to every
day things...the strange and mundane aspects of life...","either having a yummy dinner at home, meeting friends, or just
hanging with my dog, doing nothing or reading. typical things, i
guess. i'd be very happy looking at beautiful art or listening to
beautiful music also, which i do often. basically, i do a lot of
what we all might do on a typical friday night (but it would be
great to share even the mundane friday nights with you:)",i talk to my dog...,"you are ready to be in a relationship, know yourself well, are
curious about the world, passionate about your life and things you
love, and really want to share yourself and your life with
someone.<br />
<br />
(currently, i'm living most of the time in san francisco. but, i'm
open to other different locations, especially boston, providence,
new york, europe (especially italy and the uk)<br />

like i'm still adjusting to california and the left coast. i grew
up near dc, have a part of my soul still in nyc, moved here from
abroad (s and se asia), and am so far digging it here. i feel
fortunate to have landed in oakland for the lake, its parks and
diversity. i love the mix of nature with some semblance of city
life.<br />
<br />
what else? i try to go into things with a lot of openness and
without preconceived notions or suspicion. i am flexible yet have
opinions, and i'm committed to certain ideals but don't take myself
too seriously. i'm attracted to motivated people who can also have
a great time, let go and relax.","i am meeting new people, asking questions, making connections and

for films - in the cinema and on my laptop. i've been watching
online programming on al jazeera (english) lately as my news and
entertainment, as well as my regular dose of the daily show. at the
moment i tend to focus on fiction about asia and by asian authors,
or about immigrant or multiple experiences of all kinds. or i get
into magazine modes - usually the new yorker -- and don't make
enough time for books.<br />

i love food, too - eating and cooking. i am a fish/seafood eating
vegetarian - whatever label you want to put on it - but appreciate
all kinds of food and am all about people getting in their protein.","some things that keep me going include:<br />

i enjoy reading but to be quite honest, i don't read half as much
as i would like (or like to pretend :)) to. this is due partly
because of my work schedule. the other part is plain old laziness.
that said, i enjoy reading and i am trying to incorporate it more
into my day to day.<br />
<br />
i love, love, love music! some of my favorite genres are r&amp;b,
hip-hop, soca, kompa (i'd be impressed if you know what this is
without looking it up first... any takers?), and reggae. however,
ultimately, if it sounds good, i'll listen to it.<br />
<br />
i enjoy running. in march 2010, i ran my first half marathon here
in oakland. i am very happy that i completed the marathon without
stopping and within my time goal. depending on how my training
goes, i may run a full marathon next year. i love dancing! if i
could do it professionally i would in a heartbeat. unfortunately, i
am no where near being a trained dancer. alas, i will have to stick
to the 9 to 5 pm (more like 9-7pm) as a community organizer. i'm a
pseudo- movie buff. i love watching contemporary films, classic
dramas from the 40's-50's, independent films and
documentaries.<br />
<br />
work keeps me busy but one day i would like to spend more time
traveling. four countries that i would love to visit are thailand,
haiti, brazil and senegal (i have already been to 2 of the

okay but seriously....<br />

generic stuff: i grew up in the east bay then went off to the east
coast for college. i survived the winters there (honestly it was
the muggy summers i hated the most) then i moved back to the bay
after graduation. i am currently working in oakland and living with
the parentals. don't hate me for keeping my cost of living low!
=)<br />
<br />
i am always down to laugh and eat, admittedly, sometimes both at
the same time and its not very pretty. =p i am a loyal friend and i
consider myself a pretty easy going person. although i have been
told that i can be intimidating. lol which i think is hilarious. i
like sports, basketball is my main love though. if you have tickets
to any warriors or giants games then holler!!! hahaha<br />
dancing is a somewhat recently discovered passion. specifically hip
hop and step. i'm really not that great of a dancer but i try! i
was on my college's female step and hip hop teams and enjoyed every
minute of it! i also like to have open discussions....kind of takes
me back to the days in the college dorms...so please don't bother
me if you don't like a girl with a mind of her own. and finally, my
family is a huge influence in my life and i consider their opinions
pretty heavily.<br />
<br />
if you made it this far give yourself a pat in the back!",i work at an optometry office in oakland.,"haha i'm not great, but i love to play basketball and i practice
karate. i like to work on community events when i'm not working.

we'll get to know each other better that way. not offering any

early age. it's just take a while to get here.<br />
the earliest memories i have of being a <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=dom"">dom</a> were in kindergarten. i was always that
little boy on the playground who managed to be the doctor when we
all played. in fact, i was the one who instigated it most of the
time. and while i have had a few breaks from being a dom over the
years, mostly in an effort to find myself, i remain a strong,
loving, sometimes playfully scary <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=dominant"">dominant</a> still. some time ago, i spent
a few years figuring myself out. and though it's a cliche, i came
full circle to find myself back where i started, but being able to
see myself in a new light. i know who i am. i know what i want from
life. and i know what i want with my partners.<br />
i've lived most my life here in the bay area, although i've lived
in london, san diego and la for short periods of time. in 2005 i
finished my masters in business administration, and i love riding
my motorcycle. i taught my wife to ride a few years ago and she
recently purchased a really great bike. among my favorite fetishes
are, etiquette books, strong and intelligent women, silver tea
sets. i'm also really into staying healthy and plan to live to be
110 and in good health all the way. to accomplish that, i work out
at the gym 3-5 days a week and really love it, and eat really well
about 90% of the time. lately my wife has been throwing sunday
football parties with a girlfriend of hers, they are much bigger
fans than i am, and i cut loose from the healthy food with some
dark chocolate and scotch, pizza and other yummies.<br />
<br />
i am a daddy, dominant, and big hearted","the most important thing going on in my life right now is my
relationship with my wife and slave. in every way i have been able
to discover, she is the woman i have always wanted to be with. we
have an amazingly loving and beautiful <a class=""ilink"" href=

i'm a <a class=""ilink"" href=

wasn't intense enough and i wanted to crank it up a few notches. ;)
well, not exactly. it's more because i enjoy working as staff on

one last note, the okc should offer fuzzy age ranges for someone
the ""i'm looking for"" section. don't take those ranges as limits in
either direction. when it comes to age, what i'm looking for is

to them, intelligent enough to get it, and young enough to play.

entanglements (i.e. no children or other girlfriends)<br />
my birth sign is cancer. i spent my early years as a<br />
resident of n.y.,n.y. and consider myself well<br />
traveled and of a cosmopolitan nature. i do not<br />
participate in any organized religion, i do however<br />
recognize that there is something greater than the<br />
human race and believe that we are not intelligent<br />
enough to name it. if you choose to call that line of<br />
thought spiritual, then so be it. i have two college<br />
degrees and can hold up my end of a conversation. i am<br />
an x-jock, who continues to works out on a regular<br />

shape. i scored a 46 on the real age test!","i work as a housing advocate for a small nonprofit in the mission
district. while i have never made as little money as i do now - i
have also never been more satisfied in my job. for the first time
in my life, i actually feel as if i am making a positive difference
in my community. i also help write/influence legislation that
revolves around housing issues such as building code and health
code violations - i spend a lot of time sitting in hearings in city
hall. i am also a warrior for just about any other social injustice

to meet in a dark alley - my personality is actually the exact
opposite. that i am warm, caring and smart as a ""whip"" that i dress

seriously and understand that i am a person of integrity. that i
have a great deal of compassion for my fellow human being. my

unique quality to my voice and even though i can't hear it, that i

"" double indemnity"", ""the third man"", ""the sweet smell of success"",

intellectual and literate, i can also be goofy, but i detest

musician, actor, dreamer, hard worker, dancer, reader, extremely
hip but not a hipster...lover of plants and animals, french red
wine, and all the arts. mildly bohemian, traveled, often a loner,
very nice, stubborn, exuberant, lazy, hilarious sense of humor.
dark moody social butterfly ( :) ) walker, hiker, never ending
conundrums of quirkiness. open-minded, neither right nor left,
materialistic nor ascetic, atheist nor devout. life more life and
everything in between. i don't despise money, but i despise the
worship of it. look like the girl next door and i can be a little
schoolmarmy, but that belies a wild and whimsical streak. i am more
glamorous than the photos i chose to display. plenty of education
from east to west...i love to learn. don't own a cell phone or a

"i think i'm a fun, outgoing person and people who love me would
agree. i enjoy making new friends, organizing happy hours and
getting people to laugh. i am fairly intuitive and can read people
easily. i also give great life advice but am terrible at listening
to it myself. i am very close to my family and friends - they are
priorities in my life.<br />
<br />
fair warning, i have been known to be a little on the sarcastic
side... and in a little, i mean kind of a lot. it's always in jest
but if you are extra-sensitive or lack a sense of humor, we
probably wouldn't be a good match.<br />
<br />
i am very active - i work out regularly, love hiking and yoga and
am starting to discover fun outdoor activities in the bay. after a
long time in la, i moved back to the bay area last year and it's
interesting to re-discover everything as an adult. while i
prioritize fitness, i don't necessarily need someone who is super
fit - just someone who is healthy and willing to try new
adventures.<br />
<br />
i am a working professional but i don't super love my job - so i
won't hold it against you if you're not doing something you're
passionate about. fantastic if you are. for now, my job is a
stabilizing factor in my life that allows me to be comfortable,
feel secure and have fun when i'm not working (admittedly, there
are periods when i work insane hours).<br />
<br />
in the interest of time and based on my quick review of the male
profiles out there, i should just put some things on the table
right now:<br />
<br />
1. i care very much about what is going on in the world, but i also
read gossip magazines. i listen to npr but i watch the housewives
of beverly hills. i love indie music, but i frequently have britney
spears jam sessions. so if you're self-righteous and anti-pop
culture, you'll probably hate me.<br />
<br />
2. bad grammar is a turn off.<br />
<br />
3. the age range specified isn't open to interpretation. no,
really. please don't contact me if you're old enough to be my
father. i work with enough old creepy guys, i don't need to date
them.","living it? i'm not really sure how to answer this in a complete
way. i'm an attorney by trade but still don't know what i want to
be when i grow up.",making people laugh and baking cupcakes,"probably my smile, it reaches my eyes.","books: the steig larsson series - i stayed up until 5am to read the
last one and then couldn't fall asleep.<br />
<br />
movies: the king's speech, edward scissorhands, cool runnings, home
alone, my girl. and a million others. and this isn't really a
movie, but tosh.0 has this amazing recap of the human centipede
that everyone should watch. it's hilarious and exactly my sense of
humor.<br />
<br />
music: everything except for trance and nickelback (can someone
please explain their success?)<br />
<br />
food: my mom's pho. mcdonald's soft serve. hot n spicy cheez its.
veggie omelets (with egg whites to balance out the soft serve and
cheez its). white nectarines (when they are in season, they
comprise 80% of my daily intake. no joke, my record is 15 in one
day.)","1. my family<br />

i am a kitchen top, i love being involved in the process of food,
from garden/farm to the stove to the table. i love animals, and i
havent eaten meat for 9+ years. my status says mostly vegan,

books: i am an avid reader. my primary focus of study has been

"nice to meet you guys, i'm ryan. for 3/4 of my life, i lived in a
few small towns in ohio and michigan and while i now live in a big
city, i love having the small town pespective as well. afterwards,
i moved to los angeles for grad school and once that was done,
moved here for my first real job. i've now been at the same firm
for 7 years and i continue to grow in my career. things are good
from a professional perspective. i enjoy my living situation, as i
live in my condo in noe valley that i remodeled last year.
currently, i have two roommates, a guy that is also originally from
ohio (found on craigslist) and a lovable cat that i adopted from
the spca :) i'm missing that right guy in my life that challenges
me and complements me (compliments are nice too :p). that's why i'm
here, to find the right guy that is...","i consult to some well known employers on the benefits they offer
to their employees. it's more interesting than it sounds (every
work day is different), and i've been doing it 7 years now. i like
to get the gym outta the way first thing in the morning, then
commute to the financial district. evenings consist of either
relaxing at home or meeting up with friends. if the weather is nice
on the weekend, i enjoy catching an hour or two of sun on my deck.","-organizing my life and the space around me (i'd love that special
guy to challenge me on this through his spontaneity!)<br />
-thinking of and being there for others<br />
-taking care of my cat<br />
-cooking (and eating)<br />
-cuddling<br />
-i'm an intj and am good with small group and individual
interactions, as well as wanting some personal time every so often.
i attend large social events as well, but i'll likely not be the
loud one!<br />
-i'm not precisely punctual, but i'm never rudely and
embarrassingly late either.","lately, i've overwhelmingly heard my smile. teeth are up there too,
thanks to my ""frientist"" (hey, he was my friend before my dentist!)
:p","books - i've taken a pause from these for now...<br />
<br />
movies/tv - not much of a tv watcher on my own...i'd rather half
pay attention and be cuddled up with that special guy :)<br />
<br />
music - in the mornings, country or musical/showtunes get me ready
for the day...before going out for the night, it's usually dance,
electronic, and pop...<br />
<br />
food - i'm not picky, but a nice rare filet mignon and fries (with
ketchup for the fries, of course!), interesting sushi rolls, and
the usual international fare will always sit well in my
stomach...dark chocolate with red wine always makes for a nice
ending to a meal! i detox a few times a year, so that is when i do
become very picky!","how about one thing...i've thought about this and the one thing i
could never do without is ""balance""...all too frequently, we go in

we each have it. i'll step off the spiritual soapbox now and update

been in two relationships and had a handful of very sweet lovers
and learned some important lessons: #1 women in their 40's are
really hot, i'm not sure why it took me so long to figure it out.
#2 i'm not so interested in a monogamous relationship (though i
sure was flirting with the idea.) #3 i am not on the internet
looking for serious love, but there are some very nice people out
here and i love having the excuse to have intense interactions with
strangers.)<br />

"greetings : looking to date the right woman and possibly have a
great relationship down the road when we are both ready to embrace
it together. i am definitely open to meeting more single
lesbians/bi ladies for friendship too. it can be a jungle out there

<br />
about me: i am in my early 40's, blond/blue, hwp,
employed/financially independent, good relationship with my family.
i am an east bay native and have lived here for most of my adult
life, but i grew up overseas. i have my own place and love to be at
home - but additionally love to get out there and explore
everything the bay area has to offer; wine country, restaurants,
hiking, sport outings, film festivals, live music, bbq's, game
nights with friends, farmer's markets, dive bars/pool, street fairs
etc.....the list can go on and on - we live in a fantastic place!
what do you like to do for fun? i am kind hearted, love to laugh,
enjoy engaging in meaningful conversations that transform you, have
great friends, and am emotionally stable minded. i was in a ltr for
three years that ended earlier in the year and feel like its honest
to be upfront about not wanting to rush into anything too
quick.<br />
<br />
about who i'm looking for? i know that i am more attracted to women
who are on the feminine side of the spectrum and tend to be 5-10
years younger than me historically. someone who is a good
communicator - not an avoider and can be open about their feelings
so it doesn't have to be 24-hour therapy. i believe that friendship
should be first and a good value system is key. boundries and
respect make healthy relationships and we all have our baggage. if
you have forever baggage, drama, want threesomes with your guy,
flakey, consistently late, then i'm not the match for you. i
consider myself a sexual person - so that should definitely be
there or let's be honest and say you like each other as friends.
more friends that are real would be great!<br />
<br />
i know the importance of having a career we all enjoy - but i'm not
looking for a workaholic...someone who appreciates a balance. if
you are constantly rearranging your schedule to spend time
together, we will probably run into some conflicts. i'll talk shop
with you - but turn the computer off eventually! i also think it's
important to have our own friends and interests, but make time for
each other too. i would prefer that you are out to your family and
friends. i am and have this work behind me, and moreover believe
that's just necessary at this point in my interest for
compatibility or even fun dating. i applaud the ladies who are just
coming out, i am just in a different place! i enjoy going to lgbt
events in the community and it would be great if you are aware of
our pride. bonus points if you enjoy live music and independent
films/documentaries. brainiacs with a quick wit quirky smarty pants
type of humor are turn-ons and have made me weak in the knees..lol.
two huge thumbs up for brunettes - guess we are attracted to what
we are not...aforementioned...i'm blonde and femme as posted in the

my life philosophy is that life is short and should be lived with a
fiery zest. i try to bring joy to those around me. i'm one of the
most optimistic and honest people i know. to a fault.<br />
<br />
i've been told that talking to me is therapeutic. i'm mature for my
age. my vibe is one of intellectual curiosity. in my opinion, the
only thing better than a great conversation is a spontaneous

food: i make killer chilaquiles. i also endeavor to try every
noodle soup ever created by humankind, and to find a best-case
hamburger for every predicament. i indulge in creative
overly-conceptual cuisine, but i love banh mi. and everything in

burritos are better than tacos. and, most importantly: there is no
distance, be it by car, train, or plane, that will keep me away
from something delicious.<br />
<br />
movies/television: i've been enjoying some random documentaries on
netflix streaming in glorious hd. i'm fond of sci-fi with utterly
implausible science -- fringe is a recent guilty pleasure (a friend
and i recently theorized on how to make it possible for
shapeshifters to exist while accounting for conservation of mass).
i've also watched nearly the entire series of star trek: the next
generation, though i also geek out in the other direction by

--<br />
a real life friend of mine wrote this testimonial on some other
networking site (tribe.net). it's apt and i like it:<br />
<br />
""how do i begin? she is quintessentially real. reality oozes from
her pores. she is so real that she doesn't need to be honest, like
honesty doesn't exist because there is no other option. like asking
a fish what it lives in.<br />
<br />
she is forward and confrontive. <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=bullshit+free+zone"">bullshit free zone</a> extends
about 4 feet radius from her.<br />
<br />
she cares. she cares so much that she has to protect herself from
caring. her vulnerability there makes me pissed about the world and
motivates me to do something so that she can be free to care as
much as is good for her.<br />
<br />
she is funny. doesn't catch all my humor, or any ""all"" about me,
but she doesn't care. she treats me the way she thinks i deserve,
and she plays, and likes funny. and she plays and likes serious,
and she plays and just lets herself play<br />
<br />
she has a great ass. she knows it and does not abuse her advantage.
she radiates sensuality, including the sex part, but she is just
she, not someone trying to be sexy or sensual.<br />
<br />
she needs a lot of love. not any more than the vast majority of
people in the world, but somewhere deep she has not accepted what
most people accept - that you can live with a lot less love if you
give up most of your humanity. i love that about her, because that
means she is an ally that can be counted on.<br />
<br />
i will arbitrarily stop here.""<br />
--<br />
that about sums it up. the ""forward and confrontive"" part is
something to take particular note of- i ask a lot of questions and
often my motivation is mistaken. believe in yourself and we're ok.","running a business teaching <a class=""ilink"" href=

clowns, hope for the flowers, different loving, report from engine
co. 82...<br />
<br />
movies: ma vie en rose, amlie, moulin rouge, aladdin, finding
nemo, legally blonde...this is embarrassing, i'm stopping now. i
generally prefer to do something rather than watch something. i
find horror, action, and suspense either boring, irritating or

over and over again and it doesn't work. i'll try again if you ask
nicely. i used to be a metalhead but i'm pretty well over that

nyc pizza, sushi, avocados, sushi, weird scary stuff, sushi. and

they all have the same, stupid, predictable plot. give me 'the

hard, and taking everything seriously. when i asked a woman friend
to give me feedback on a previous version of this profile, she
cautioned me that the foregoing sentence might suggest, to someone

"let's start with why i'm here. i have a profile because all the
people i like hanging out with are in san francisco, but i don't
live in sf.<br />
<br />
i created this profile so i could meet people in my immediate area
to hang out with when i'm not in the city. so far i've met a few
interesting people, but more would be better.<br />
<br />
ok, so what do i define as interesting? for starters, people who
are good at things and not afraid to tell me about it, make things
happen instead of waiting for things to happen to them, like
learning about the world they're in and the people who exist in it.
are you passionate about something? can you communicate it? great,
let's get <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=coffee"">coffee</a>!<br />
<br />
so what about me? well i quit university to take a job in the tech
industry and i've been building that career ever since. i don't
have a typical engineering position though. until recently, i
worked in sales, helping to build solutions for potential
customers. this married my passion for creative problem-solving
with my fascination of people. i love figuring out what makes
people tick.<br />
<br />
i now work in corporate security, which is all about weighing
various risks. interestingly, some of the biggest risks are people.
i try to convince them to engage in less dangerous behavior and
demonstrate why it's in their interest to do so. it's a challenge
:)<br />
<br />
i'm really interested in what makes everything work. as you can
probably tell, how social interactions work is really fascinating
to me. when i encounter a new social situation, i like to observe
until i figure out what's expected and who's doing well, then i
start experimenting to see what works. i take that same approach
with computers, business meetings, sports, etc.<br />
<br />
i like doing anything competitive, <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=running"">running</a>, and <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=skiing"">skiing</a> (i finally bought a new pair of
skis after 12 years, my how the sport has changed!). last year i

<br />
i have 5 piercings. one of them is in my tongue--can you figure out
where the other 4 are?<br />
<br />
once everything else falls into place (house, solid retirement
investments, etc), i would love to <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=travel"">travel</a> all over the world--europe, the
mediterranean, japan, and china.<br />
<br />
personality: istj - the inspector (i took the test before i joined;
perhaps i'll retake it to see if it's changed at all in a
year).<br />
<br />
i am honest, passionate, and clever","reevaluating a lot of my views on life to see which are still
useful and which are not. i'm not afraid to admit mistakes, and i'm
willing to make new ones. as long as i become better in the
process, it's worth it.<br />
<br />
ok, so i'm not <i>totally</i> fearless. sometimes i get dragged
into things kicking and screaming, but i (almost) always end up
thankful. being around people who push me is great.","solving problems, and getting people to like me. conveniently, both
of these are a big part of my daily work.<br />
<br />
driving long distances. public speaking. laughing often.<br />
<br />
i've also been told i'm good at making outrageous facial
expressions.","my eyes, or the smirk. you'll definitely notice when i'm smirking.","books: anything from no starch press (geeky stuff). i used to enjoy
reading about philosophy and ethics, but i haven't made much time
for that since launching my career.<br />

clear a path quickly enough. that was a really wet and
uncomfortable ride home. now it's an anecdote :)","- you are able to form coherent thoughts and communicate them

- you know what fetlife is and would be interested in potentially
playing (this does not mean sex).<br />

last 15 books i read, but i realized it was only there so i could
let everyone know i read <em>the red and the black</em> a few years
ago.}<br />
<br />
<em>the red and the black</em> - stendahl. i like old books because
you get a sense of the things that change and the things that stay
the same. this book surprised me with how coldly modern and funny
it was.<br />
<br />
movies: drive, black swan, true grit, adaptation, glory, eternal
sunshine, the royal tbaums, man on wire, werner herzog, the thin
red line, the new world, eastern promises, the big lebowski, and
any movie that makes the first few minutes of reality after the
theater door seem really weird. if i had connections i would be
raising money for a project where we pay werner herzog to record
audiobook versions of everything in the library of congress.<br />
<br />
tv: 30 rock, always sunny, tosh.0, bachelor pad, shows where they
fix cars, random soccer games on telemundo.<br />
<br />
bookmarks: andrew sullivan, glenn greenwald, fffffound, kotke.org,
hey crackhead<br />
<br />
podcasts: marc maron, the nerdist, this american life, mohr
stories<br />
<br />
music: robyn, the walkmen, adele, the rapture, the magnetic fields,
the unicorns, electrelane, the xx, stars of the lid, julianna
barwick, the thermals, the silver jews. i love joanna newsom. throw
a banjo in there, i'm interested. the last 4 albums i bought were
the drums, jeffrey lewis, operation ivy, and the drive soundtrack.","i fiend for information flowing into my dome. mostly this takes the
form of news &amp; commentary articles on the internet. reading
actual books fits in there. i listen to music when i can. all of
this goes into the talking - i love talking about stuff. usually
during the talking we'll be drinking, which often leads to more
music and then dancing.",systems,hoping that someone is having a party with a dance floor.,"ok so i have a spreadsheet of all the books i've ever read. so sue

great to see a dated list of all the books your grandpa ever read?",you should message me

snarky, but interestingly i hate that type of humor most in tv and

climbing, skiing, baking, going to happy hour, gossiping, trying
new recipes, avoiding going grocery shopping, collecting quarters

eat, slathering myself in cocoa butter, looking longingly at my
skis in the closet and then shutting the door to try and make
myself feel better, trying to think of a good weekend getaway to
experience real summer, drinking bottomless mimosas with the girls,
watching trashy television with my roommate, walking through ggp,

first of all, i made this profile at 4 in the morning in a fit of
mania from a night of dancing and painting...<br />
i am a passionate inspirational artist, who will help shape the
face of culture and society with my actions, art, and words! i love
love, in the most unconditional of ways, although intimate love is
important allbyitself. i also enjoy absurdity, and surrealism.
hunter s. thompson once wrote that he was on the quest to find the
american dream, and i intend on honoring his name by continuing his
work. on a different note, i practice shamanism and working of
energy within those who are disfunctional to better help all of my
relations to take the next step in evolution. i believe that
gratitude is the key to our collective human evolution from the
management of scarcity that is our current motivation, and with the
abolition of the trappings of clandestine power; our co-creation of
a more symbiotic and therefore healthier human condition will
begin. if you enjoy poetry, read the lovesong of j. alfred.
prufrock. for some reason every time i read that poem, the last
stanza fills me with tears, and they overflow from behind these
eyes to better meet with gravity's grace and fall to earth so
gently like a kiss could have been placed...","art, art, poetry, adventure, danciing, art, music art, adventure,
art...looking cool in music videos...taking part in documentaries
about current art mediums... living inspirational!","making what you think is impossible a reality through pure
willpower. (and magic) im also good at stiching, dancing, looking
at people right in the eye... finding things that are small and
wonderful...","my throat chakra tattoo... or the way i move my body on the dance
floor, or maybe the paint that is always all over me...depends on

mallon, mf doom, dj hidden, cocorosie, edit, flying lotus, bad bad
not good, kryptic minds, tycho, mu-ziq, and lots of other artists

<br />
i love food and the creation thereof!","<strong>paint</strong>, <strong>sex</strong>, a well made knife, my
limbic system, coconut water and the <strong>stars</strong>!","first of all, my main attempt in life is to be here now! but when i
cannot comply with this, i think of sex and how to create art
uniquely. also the fractal nature of everything, the origin of the
universe, (i.e. why are there essents rather than nothing) what i
want to explore next, and with whom... compassion, empathy,
intuition, and what the dali lama thinks of all this.","dancing or painting or buring bonfires on the beach...or burning
paintings while dancing around them... you know... whatever the
spirit arouses.","i made off with 33 pirate flags at burning man in 2010...

if i made you laugh and lastly if you can define
tintinnabulation... ring any bells?"
"i could say alot of things here, and you still won't know who i am.
who could i be? some static self-image scraped together to surround
a frail psyche? what horrors must we house within ourselves to
require such viciously tentative illusions? it seems such shades
are more a service to ourselves than to others. insubstantial
edifices secluding the statements: i am poor, i'm lost, i'm scared,
i'm insignificant, i'm tired, i'm lonely, i'm human.<br />
perpetual reflections reexaminations of this thing called life have
left me thoroughly disenchanted with myself, and, just to give you
a heads up: you. do you think you're special, that you're going to
make the world dance to your offbeat...whatever? errrtt! guess
again, snowflake! sure, i get it, everyone wants to be made to feel
special, and that's what we're all here for, right? and yeah, i got
my own things going on that make me get up in the morning, but i
work equally hard to keep my delusions in scope as in focus.<br />
<br />
whatever you care about, or think you care about, doesn't really
matter. whatever i care about, doesn't really matter. sorry. i know
you don't care about half of that shit i do, and shouldn't, unless
you already do. i won't like something just because you do, but
that doesn't mean i am so committed to a concept i can't change my
mind. i can be quite polite, but begrudgingly suffer through the
majority of humanity. i would say that 99% of the population are
caught up in the more trivial aspects of existence (when is
____coming out?, what does____think/say?, want to get _____?). 1%
are significantly less so, and as such, have the privilege of at
least being my friend. the remaining negligible infinitesimal of a
percent is purely theoretical, as i have yet to find even one
person who is really on my level. believe me, i've really tried
over the years, and it's pretty much been trying to fit a square
peg into a 5 dimensional polytope. not that i'm all that or
anything, but i'm not out to waste my time, or yours.","trying not to die. so far the project has been a smashing success
with only a few minor setbacks (ironically, mostly due to being
alive). in the meantime, i'm an archaeologist turned teacher. i
write and sing heartfelt songs about your mother sucking dick and
your dad jacking off, and how you shouldn't judge because that's
the kind of stuff you do yourself. i just finished my thesis, and
am writing a ballot initiative to amend prop 13. i suffer fools
poorly (and unfortunately, often) and find that my most engaging
conversations are with animals. i brew wine and self-medicate, but
find myself quite responsible given my lifestyle.","being a sarcastic asshole in a jovially cheeky manner. also adept
at employing scatological humor. other than that, too many things
to be really good at any of them. i enjoy writing, singing, and
writing music. i am really good at making animal noises, as well as
perfectly emulating someone's voice and demeanor. this skill may
take some time to adapt to new acquaintances, but it always is an
inexhaustible well of comedy once i perfect someone's particular
cadence.",there literally is no one else like me,"the book of five rings, the popol vuh, the hitchhikers guide to the

"i grew up mostly in new jersey, then moved to new york after
college, a plan i'd hatched as a kid, or was it by sheer magnetism?
it didn't really work for me, and that realization was cemented
when i came to live and school in berkeley, now 25 years ago. in
addition to getting absorbed in a (mostly) fun grad program, i
loved the idea of escaping to the outdoors by running/ biking up
the hill from campus and continue that habit to a lesser degree
today.<br />
my best friend's brother went into architecture- with that small
inspiration, i decided to give it a go and have been in the field
ever since, liking the practical side as much or more so than the
theoretical. i like using a hammer.<br />
i was married in 2001 to my friend of many years and we went on to
have two girls who are now 8 and 11. the girls are very much at the
center of my life. the relationship shifted away from romantic, tho
we remain friends and co parents. we have not divorced but will not
be going back. she is now living w/loving another mom and her 2
kids, so lots of adjustments for all concerned.<br />
at this point, having had some time for things to settle, i feel
like i'm ready to create something new.","i like designing, and am mostly busy with modest remodeling
projects, sometimes exhibit design. a lot of my time and energy
goes in the direction of the 2 girls, soccer, homework, music, etc.
meanwhile, i do want to create a good, no great, new adult
relationship. in spare time, i like running, hiking, being in the
outdoors, being at home, oh and love to commute/ ride around on my
bike more and more.","drawing, tinkering, listening; not too bad at being a dad","probably light on the hair (meaning little of not light bouncing

"i'm a very active, driven kind of person. i would describe myself

like to say i keep a balance between my appetite for excellent,
sometimes non-traditional fiction and trashy mags. i have had a few
lives all rolled into one amazing adventure over the last three
decades - artist, educator, academic, traveler. into each of these
endeavors i have passionately thrown myself completely, and that's
generally how i conduct my relationships as well. however, i am
looking for a bit of temperance and balance all around in my older,
wiser age.<br />

"it took a few months before i was able to begin filling this
section. i can see that this is going to be a work in
progress.<br />
<br />
as a start, you should know that i enjoy the simple things in life.
i love a good hike in the woods. some of my favorite places to hike
are in pt reyes, redwood regional park, and mt. tamalpais. i am
always looking for other places to explore whether in the east bay,
sf, or in marin county. i love going to the movies, walking on the
beach, going to the museum, and listening to live music. i must
admit that i watch television for my favorite weekly the good wife,
the mentalist, the chew ( i like the variety of foods cooked by the
chefs), kqed's check, please!, and who do you think you are?<br />
<br />
i like the theater and live performances from time to time. i
recently became intrigued with opera when i saw a dress rehearsal
of the ring last season. there is so much passion, drama and human
intrigue in each story.<br />
<br />
i like getting together with my family and friends. we celebrate
each other's joys and comfort each other when there are tears. food
helps a lot...we like to eat together.<br />
<br />
i have a special love for dragon boat racing and had been active in
the sport. our team travels to different parts of the country to
race and meet the most interesting people at these events. i am
ready to explore other activities such as sea kayaking. i can be
really active but i can also enjoy lounging around watching a good
movie or read a good book.<br />
<br />
i have a career that has been very rewarding. i am grateful for my
family and have the fortune of having friends who are close to me.
i value spending time volunteering in the community with special
interest groups, i.e., car seat check-up events.<br />
<br />
i have interest in further developing my spirituality and seeking
ways to grow and to improve self awareness.<br />
<br />
i love to travel. i had the fortune to visit france, italy, norway,
australia, new zealand and parts of asia. i like to take my time to
experience the culture and the people wherever i am
traveling.<br />
<br />
at this time in my life, i am looking forward to meeting that
special man who is kind, compassionate, honest, sincere, as well as
someone who has integrity, and a great sense of humor. i will
reciprocate whole-heartedly.",exploring the next chapter in my life.,i am a good listener.,my smile.,"i really enjoyed a house in fez by suzanna clark. this is a
fascinating story of how suzanna and her husband bought a house in

by julia butterfly hill, paris portraits by harrett lane levy,
every day in tuscany, queen noor: a leap of faith, steve jobs,
water for elephants, kiwi's can fly.<br />
i love the movies and go whenever i can but mostly watch dvd's from
netflix. my taste in music is rather eclectic.<br />
i am not a foodie as some of my friends are but i like to eat good
food. i love eating at a great hole-in-the-wall and explore foods
from other cultures.","my family and friends<br />

looking for men to explore this great region from tahoe to vegas to

<br />
i like most of the bs people write in this section. i enjoy skiing,
blaming others, running, walking really slow through intersections,
working out, hiking, red wine, scotch, and dinner out with friends.

"i'm sincere, passionate, open-minded, adventurous, playful,
affectionate, introspective, kind, and down to earth. i value
authenticity.<br />
<br />
my life is about continuously learning, exploring new things,
becoming more self-aware, and challenging myself.<br />
<br />
i love spending time in nature and also being around animals
(although i have no pets at the moment).<br />
<br />
my friends might tell you that i'm good person to be around in the
wilderness, during an emotional crisis, or during a zombie
apocalypse ;)<br />
<br />
i've been around many different kinds of people, done some
travelling, and grown a lot from the experiences in my life.<br />
<br />
i'm in grad school now studying psychology, which is a big passion

outside of school.","i'm in the process of becoming a psychotherapist and i work part
time at a non-profit.<br />

i spend my spare time playing music, getting outdoors, volunteering
for wilderness search and rescue, and doing my own psychological
and spiritual work.","playing acoustic guitar. communicating. picking up on unspoken
stuff when it's not being communicated. listening to people.
bonding with animals. driving and using my sense of direction.

something i am interested in or that helps me think in new

also into latin music, rock, punk, jazz, celtic, classical and
other stuff.<br />
<br />
i like most types of food, but i am very health conscious and i
don't like to put junk in my body. i think the average american
diet of sugary processed foods is way out of wack from what is
natural and healthy. i've been doing the <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=paleo"">paleo</a> diet for over a year, which has been
awesome. i eat mostly good quality meat, vegetables, and fish, plus
some nuts and fruit. i cook most of my own meals and my main staple
is a big organic salad with some local pastured raised meat in it
and some coconut water to wash it down. yum!","1) nature, especially remote mountains<br />

great joy in my life and certainly my most important job. their
father lives nearby, and we have a civil relationship with no
drama. he's very involved in the kids' lives, but he's not a part
of my personal life at all.","* playing music. i play piano, mostly classical and a little jazz
(rusty now).<br />

thanks for reading. i live in a van that's set-up as an rv by
choice and enjoy a comfortable and stress free life style. no
mortgage or rent and the solution for a noisy neighbor is the turn
of a key away. beyond simplicity, i think what's most appreciated
about living this way is that every day is a little adventure. i
live life both purposefully and spontaneously. i like being
challenged by random events and thinking on my feet.<br />
why would i be a good boy friend? i'm a confident, romantic,
creative, and affectionate man with a good sense of humor. am good
conversation too and dependable. my life is usually a simple one
with simple pleasures and am happy. i never have mood swings or get
depressed and am rarely fearful. i'm open minded and accepting of
people and their choices. who am i searching for? a woman who's
calm and self assured and happy with her life. also pleasantly
out-going, with a good sense of humor, and still interested in
intimacy. i like my life and don't have plans to change it
significantly so am not seeking co-habitation. beautiful women come
in all shapes, sizes, and colors so don't make distinctions. it's
really about mutual chemistry. if it's there and we feel a good
connection then there's a potential. if not, then we continue our
search. i'm healthy, completely std free, am active, and enjoy the
out-doors, travel, and new experiences. if you like what's been
shared i hope you'll take a moment and ask to learn more.
thanks<br />

p.s. friends have recommended concealing or not making mention of
living in a van as it puts women off. i've declined to do that as
feel it would be deceptive though don't mean to over emphasize it.

i've seen an obscene amount of movies in my lifetime. 97% of my
wardrobe consists of black clothing. i've never lost a game of
strip poker in my life. i love cheesy kung fu movies old or new.
i'm a wizard when it comes to anything technology, i have a youtube
addiction and i'm proud to admit it<br />
<br />
i can't stand fake/superficial people or people who have no sense
of reality,the yankees,black licorice,light or low carb
beer,stupidity,bikers who wear spandex ,cars that drive with their
high beams on all the time,buses,people that don't listen,running
out of toilet paper,missing band practice,rainy weather when i have
something to do that requires sun,and good comedians dying<br />

more to come as i think of it<br />

::update:: whats with all the people checking out my profile and
not sending me a message...why does it seem like i'm the only one
on here sending these things...don't be afraid to send me a message
if your just lookin for a friend too...can't think of anything to
say? just say hi. two letters that's all ;p<br />
<br />
also their personality profile of me is insanely inaccurate

the game"
"life has been full of challenges that i embraced and learnt
valuable lessons.<br />
through personal loss, i came to realize that life is unpredictable
and sometimes cut short. therefore, i like to seize the moment and
savor the precious things that come my way.<br />
i am very passionate about caring for others, which has been my
career for the last 25 years. i am patient, and understanding. i
listen without passing judgments or soliciting unwanted
advice.<br />
i work very hard, so i like to put the same amount of effort into
playing hard. i am very outgoing, like to do many different things,
too many to mention, but here's a few: walking, museums, art
galleries, jazz club, concerts, dancing, music, wining and dining,
movies. etc. i would also, like to entertain new and exciting
interests.<br />
i have a big bubbly personality, and can be quite flirtatious and
funny.<br />
i am also, very sensitive, sensual and romantic. i believe a
relationship takes 100% effort to keep the spark lit.<br />
i also believe respect, loyalty, and honesty are big-ticket
items.<br />
at our time of life we have to respect ourselves enough to set the
bar high for ourselves, and settle for nothing less.<br />
<br />
looking for:<br />
<br />
someone, who leads by fine examples, and has a strong and positive
influence on the people that pass through your life. you are kind
and thoughtful, and show empathy in matters of the heart. you are
not quick to anger, and can communicate your feelings when any
issues arise, are good at settling differences, even if that means
to agree to disagree and move on. if being right, means hurting
someone's feelings, does that make you feel good?<br />
you have to live life to the fullest, with energy and gusto. you
enjoy socializing and spending time with family and friends.<br />
you must be funny, smart, and playful.<br />
i have a big personality, so i need someone who can compliment me.
you have to be confident and self-assured. be decisive without
being domineering. take control of a situation without being
controlling. if you are the shy and retiring type, we may not be
suitable cohorts in getting up to mischief ?","i am trying to find a healthy balance in my life. between the job i

"i'm originally from nyc (and nj for a stint); moved to the sfba 5

saying that i don't like traveling; quite the opposite actually.

up meeting someday. lol.<br />

enjoying the outdoors, and how i manage to get into the oddest

<br />
i'll give ya this: i'm not a giggly kind of person. i'm more of the

don't crave these things.""<br />
<br />
okay, kidding aside, i asked one of my closest friends to write a
description of me. including, as i so amusingly put it, ""the good
the bad and the ugly."" i'm hilarious, i know. here is what she came
up with:<br />
<br />
kenner is one of my best friends in the world. i have never
forgotten the first time we spoke (i had a massive crush on him),
and i'm so thankful that after two attempts at trying to make it as
a couple, we recognized that what we are and are meant to be is
simply lifelong, excellent friends. &nbsp;we've seen each other
through a lot of emotional times. &nbsp;of all the people who have
come and gone in my life -- and many more have done that than i
ever thought would -- he has been a constant. &nbsp;he is a steady
rock, brutally honest, searingly intelligent, and sensitive.
&nbsp;he is a southern gentleman, and though i consider myself
independent and strong i do not mind that he insists on walking
closest to the road. &nbsp;his sense of humor ranges from silly to
absurd, including things that occasionally fly over my head. he
insists that i am smarter than him, but i know that he is smarter
than me. &nbsp;i suspect this argument may go on for years.
&nbsp;there are aspects to kenner that i suppose could be
considered ""imperfections"", but i like to think of these things as
simply non-me-compatible. &nbsp;kenner could be more outgoing and
more willing to get outside his comfort zone. he can be shy.
alcohol helps this. &nbsp;once he opens up he will surprise you,
but getting to know him at first may be difficult, or at least will
require patience. but as tom hanks says in a league of their
own,&nbsp;""if it wasn't hard, everybody would do it. the hard is
what makes it great."" &nbsp;which is to say, getting to know kenner
is deeply rewarding. &nbsp;kenner is opinionated about music and
can come off pretty elitist about it, but again, full of surprises.
&nbsp;i have cut a rug with him in my living room to jay-z, against
every expectation. &nbsp;i have also seen him wear a hanson
t-shirt. true story. &nbsp;the man won't be pinned down. &nbsp;when
i was in film school, i became so stressed out and hyper busy that
i sometimes could not find the patience to stay on the phone with
kenner, who likes to take his time with a conversation. &nbsp;if
you are in a hurry all the time, my guess is kenner is not for you
(nor you for him). &nbsp;but if you know how to prioritize quality
of life and great company over the rat race or whatever you want to
call it, then take your time to get to know this man. &nbsp;he is
awesome. &nbsp;and a really good kisser. &nbsp;<br />

really enjoy watching the person i'm with enjoy them.
repeatedly.<br />
<br />
* i'm good at math. i suck at arithmetic.<br />
<br />
* i'm omnivorous. i like food. i really like meat. i like veggies
too, but it's rare that i'll have just a salad. yet i'm a sucker
for good ethiopian food, or fried okra, or other yummy vegetables,
so there's that. i will also demolish a sushi restaurant, from the
inside out, one order at a time. i was born and raised in the
south; i have strong opinions on things like bbq.","i try to follow my heart, doing things that make me happy
personally and professionally. i find it quite fulfilling to spend
my time learning more about myself, my relationships, and the world
we live in.<br />
<br />
i'm largely unafraid to try new things, and i enjoy new
experiences. i don't always seek them out, but when i'm presented
with a choice i'll often take the road less traveled.","i'm good with computers.<br />
<br />
i can bake.<br />
<br />
i can lift heavy things.<br />
<br />
i can juggle, after a fashion.<br />
<br />
i'm a good eater, and a good listener.","people always notice my size first. it's hard not to; i can take up
an empty room. after that, it's usually my eyes, my humor, my quiet
demeanor, and my ass. not necessarily in that order. they
eventually notice i'm never what they expect; i tend to have that
effect on people. they see me and form opinions, which almost
invariably turn out to be wrong.<br />
<br />
if they get really close, they might notice that one of my vices is
a rather expensive and very subtle cologne. i've actually had women
make excuses to get right up next to me so they can sniff my neck.
one friend told me i smelled so good it actually made her wet.","favorite books: there are just so many. i'm a voracious reader. i
love reading hard sci-fi, space opera, military sci-fi, fantasy,
historical fiction, military history, pop physics, biographies, and
almost anything else i can get my hands on. i always have a huge
stack of books in my ""to read"" pile.<br />
<br />
favorite foods: i'm a sucker for sushi. i'm also quite fond of
pizza, good barbeque (which is a debate unto itself!), fried okra,
and mint chocolate chip ice cream. well-prepared meat is always a
favorite.<br />
<br />
tv: i don't watch much tv. what little i do watch tends to either
be sci-fi or police procedurals, though lately i find ""reality""
ghost hunter shows to be funny enough to hold my interest.<br />
<br />
music: i like a wide variety of music, but tend not to listen to
popular, top-40 stuff. i never listen to commercial radio. leonard
cohen is definitely on my list...one of the best lyricists ever,
and one hell of a snappy dresser to boot.<br />
<br />
movies: i don't have a list of favorite movies, though if i did,
star wars (iv and v, i.e., the first two) would be on it. so would
pi, but only if i've had a pot of coffee beforehand. mel brooks and
monty python films would definitely be on there. the original
airplane! would as well. the princess bride, alien, paranormal
activity (more for filmmaking reasons than anything else), zardoz,
logans run, planet of the apes, and other bad sci fi films (who can
beat sean connery in a safety-orange diaper, running around
declaring, ""guns are good and the penis is evil!""?) and so on. most
mst3k'd movies. ok, i lied. i guess i do have a favorite movie
list. sue me.","* internet access and a computer.<br />
<br />
* i couldn't live without my kitties (yes, i'm a large, strong
alpha male who is owned by two adorable cats).<br />
<br />
* i'd want my kindle and a credit card so i'd never run out of
reading material.","i spend a great deal of time thinking about what i want out of
life, and what matters to me in my relationships. i like to explore
how i feel about certain things, and i find i really enjoy the
journey of self-discovery. this means my tastes are constantly
evolving. to some, this can be off-putting. i, however, can't
imagine life without personal growth, exploring inner boundaries
and barriers.","i'm usually either spending a quiet night at home with my partner,
recovering from the work week, or out doing something mundane or
exotic. some nights would bore many people to tears. other nights
would shock and appall (or arouse and titillate, depending on your
bent).",i'm a huge teddy bear.,"if you can deal with the fact that i'm in an open, nonmonogamous

anyway. if you're okay with the fact that i might be intimidated by
you. we'll see where things go from there.<br />

"hi there! first, let me disclose upfront that i do use a
wheelchair, but it's actually a very small part of who i am, and
it's never stopped me from living my life. ""limits? what limits?""
is my attitude.<br />
<br />
i asked my friends to describe me, and here's what they said:<br />
peter - ""one of the best..""<br />
adrienne: ""awesome, friendly, and funny. oh and compassionate,
honest...the list goes on. :-)""<br />
jamie: ""a great cousin""<br />
cristi: ""friendly""<br />
carol: ""lover of subtle humor and wry delights""<br />
bertina: ""full of surprises. i totally saw him at panera bread
today.""<br />
philip:""one to keep up with obscure references. and awesome.""<br />
jeff: ""going to become overlord...."" (though you might want to
ignore that one...)<br />
<br />
i like baseball (go giants!) and i also squeeze in a video game now
and again...oh, and i'm teaching myself the ukelele. (if you ask
nice, i *might* see my way round to playing for you. heehee!)<br />
<br />
i get around - even made it out to england once. that was
unforgettable. seeing buck palace, trafalgar square and stonehenge
up close is something i'll never forget. that and arriving during a
freak heat wave (though really it was the humidity, being right on
the thames,) i *will* go back someday.<br />
<br />
my profile pic is pretty recent- late april '11.","i've been taking a class on how to fix computers. not so much the
physical side of things (that's fairly easy,) - but much more in
the way of ""getting rid of viruses and malware."" ...yeah, i'm a
little geeky. ;)","- getting people to lower their barriers... (i don't mean all at
once, of course. i mean, i'm all for modesty... seriously, though,
these things take time.)<br />
- spelling (i'm known in my family as the human spellcheck.)<br />
- scrabble (...ok, i'm iffy... but i have fun with it &amp; that's
more important, isn't it?) if you play, i'll take ya on...<br />
- the ""c"" chord on the ukulele (because it uses only one finger!
ha!)<br />
- not being good at math. (i am very good at not being good at
math, in fact...)<br />
- applying the phrase ""that's how i roll"" to myself non-ironically.","my eyes<br />

open to questions, and i've literally heard 'em all. ask away.)","i'm a voracious reader -i'm practically on a first-name basis with
some of the staff at barnes &amp; noble- so anything i put down
here will be out of date fast...i very highly recommend a fantastic
non-fiction book called the immortal life of henrietta lacks. just
amazing. as for fiction? i really like nick hornby's novels, shel
silverstein still sits on my shelf (and i like to think he'd
appreciate the alliteration in that sentence,) christopher moore is
funny, and several british authors (um, apart from hornby, who i
named above.)<br />

too many movies to name, but i'm a fan of the coen bros., woody
allen, steve martin, pixar, and i'll admit to liking some romcoms.
(i'll redeem myself by naming shaun of the dead as an
example.)<br />
<br />
i'm much more likely to have my ipod on than the tv...and if the tv
is on, it's probably gonna be netflix, curb your enthusiasm, the
simpsons, or a britcom like the it crowd or red dwarf.<br />
<br />
foodwise: i'm an incurable chocoholic, and daily coffee intake is a
must... apart from that....hm. chinese, italian, mexican, thai,
sushi. pizza. the good ol' american standby, the hamburger. (i'm
fairly adventurous...at least by my folks' standard - though don't
listen to my father telling you about the octopus leg hanging from
my lip!)","in no order whatsoever...<br />

my head making a wooshing noise. (though ""steve zissou"" is an
exception. i dug that one.)","you want a new friend (or more), you don't find the wheelchair
intimidating, found anything i said here intriguing, and if you can
keep up with me!"
"the more you experience in life, the harder it becomes to summarize
yourself, but i'd say that by now i have a good idea of what works
for me and what doesn't. i have a passion for art, music, food,
travel, and life in general. i'm constantly learning in many
aspects of life, sometimes the easy way, sometimes the hard way...
but either way, the important thing is that i learned, right?","doing the best i can and trying to help others do the same. i'm
looking for meaning and hoping to provide some for someone as well.
i'm a game designer by trade, but that doesn't mean i'm sitting
around playing video games all day long. i've always been a ""what
if"" kind of person, and with each ""what if"" comes a story, and with
each story, unlimited ways to tell it, show it, or experience it.
i'm an artist and an animator who taught myself programming and
have always had a passion for creative writing. i have to say,
while i've always been attracted to the idea of being a designer,
the choices i've made have just sort of landed me here, and i'm
happy.","putting 2 and 2 together. realizing when to throw in the towel, and
when not to give up. knowing my limitations. entertaining myself.

but i'm up for a drink with friends, learning something new, or
just relaxing.","for now, i'm willing to admit that i fantasize about retiring and
becoming a private detective. also, when i'm an old man, i plan on
dressing like a cowboy. no new balance sneaks for me.","you think we've got enough in common to enjoy one another and
you're not afraid to take a chance."
"hi, i'm josh. my favorite thing must be climbing stuff. trees are
ideal, but mountains or the odd monument will do in a pinch. other
interests include traveling, hiking, learning, camping, cooking,
relaxing with friends, and walking about towns, hamlets,
prefectures, forests, deserts, beaches, and the like. any excuse to
be outdoors is a good one.<br />
<br />
education is something i both enjoy and admire. i studied at
berkeley and oxford in a field related to environment and african
agricultural development... i won't bore you with details, but if
you're interested, feel free to ask. after grad school i traveled a
bit, then lived in dallas for a year. having found that it wasn't
the town for me, i came back to berkeley, a place i have always
loved and now plan to call home for years to come.<br />
<br />
if i find myself stuck indoors on a rainy weekend, i generally
read, busy myself with a house-related project, or try to prepare a
dish from another hemisphere. curries are a personal favorite, but
then again, those cured italian meats are just so good. then again,
sometimes i'll just go walk around in the rain...<br />
<br />
as far as personality goes, i am comfortable in most any situation,
and get along with pretty much anyone who isn't a jerk. i'm
easygoing, and it takes a lot to get me upset. i have a goofy side,
but the extreme goofiness is reserved for my closest friends. there
is little i appreciate more than a good, well-timed pun. i am
hard-working and ambitious, but don't take work home with me...
life is just too good to waste outside the hours of 9 and 5.<br />
<br />
i am looking for a well-adjusted, intelligent, outdoorsy, fun mate
that is open to commitment (i don't think that's too much to ask,
right?). stagnation is the enemy; i am always growing<br />
and learning, hopefully you are too.","getting the most out of it. if it's work you're curious about, i
spend 40 hours a week at an auction house, and they write me checks
in return.","cooking. don't tell anyone, but i also like to wash the dishes.","i'd like to say dimples or charm, but it's probably that i pay
attention to what they are saying, rather than simply waiting to
speak.","i've currently been on a haruki murakami bender. i'm also a fan of
lefty political stuff, and pollan/nestle type political foodie
books. my music taste is eclectic... i can't define what i like,
but i know it when i hear it. at the moment i've been listening to
a lot of white stripes, kevin johansen, and fratellis. other
favorites are toots and the maytals, manu chao, emir kustarica and
the no smoking orchestra, and the black keys, to name a few.<br />
<br />
no tv here, but i do have some favorite radio shows, including this
american life, radiolab, the moth, answer me this, the ted radio
hour, and others...","- a tent<br />
- a good pillow<br />
- a funny hat in cold weather<br />

because of a drunk girl, yah... not alot has changed and really
there's not alot on here i want to change. my whole weird profile

i didnt write that, yes i do love her but its not private, lol.
private would be like randomly crying during movies, tv shows and
music too. or how about having emotional breakdowns every once in
awhile, those are fun","if you are awesome nerdy, a gamer, cool as shit, and chill enough
to hang out with someone who is/was shy."
"i'm a young-looking, single mom of 2 teens (one of whom is in
college). i am intelligent (in lots of ways), well-educated,
passionate, and kind. i eat a balanced diet (which includes
significant doses of dark (only dark) chocolate), stay up way too
late, and definitely lean left of center. i have lots of friends,
am a great listener, and left to my own devices am never at a loss
for something to do. i am caring, compassionate, honest and direct
 the latter 2 attributes perhaps a result of my east coast roots.
i am definitely a romantic and a bit of a dreamer, despite my
practical tendencies. intimacy and passion in a relationship are
very important to me, on all levels. chemistry is a must, and lots
of things turn me on: dark skin, nice arms, beautiful eyes,
gentleness and compassion in the midst of quiet strength, an
ability to make me laugh, a passion for something you do<br />
<br />
have been on this earth long enough to know how much i don't know
(even though i know a lot!) and have really come to love the
opportunity that this stage of my life offers to keep learning new
things. spirituality has become more important to me in the last
few years, in part as a result of some big life-changing
experiences, and so finding a partner who accepts that is
important. it seems my earlier words here on the subject have been
causing (at least some) men to make some guesses about what that
really means, and it's really so much better talked about in
person. suffice it to say: i have learned at this point in my life
that one of the most important components, really, in any
relationship, is an acceptance of who we are and where we are.
that's all. if we can do that, everything else is small stuff.
:-)<br />
<br />
i'll save more of the ""real me"" details for when we meet, but i
will tell you this much: i shoot with a bow and arrow, love action
movies (especially kung fu), and really like it when a man opens
doors for me and walks on the outside of the sidewalk.<br />
<br />
one more thing for those of you without the patience to read all
the way to the end: i don't do the im thing. send me an email
instead. :-) please. i promise that no email will go unanswered (i
just think not answering would be rude -- and (incidentally) that
sentiment works both ways. if i send you an email and you're not
interested, i'd still like to see a thanks but no thanks email.
really, i'm a big girl and i can take it. :-) gracias.).","i'm busy being a mom, graphic designer/entrepreneur, and volunteer.
i don't dwell on the past, plan at least a little for the future,
and mostly try to enjoy and be in the present.","...oh, lots of things. i'm a good listener. i'm one of the most
organized people you'll ever meet. i organize stuff and i organize
people very well (that's in part where the volunteer efforts come
in). i think (despite my mistakes) i'm good at being a mom. i'm
good at being honest and direct, but tactful. i'm a good writer.
i'm a great resource for all sorts of things. oh, and i am really,
really good at making desserts, especially anything with chocolate.
and there are other things i am good at as well :-)...",...perhaps my eyes or my smile or my really long hair.,"my library is rather eclectic: nat'l geo, gardening mags; books
about kids; books about brain function; the audacity of hope; the
female brain; 1491; zinn's history of the us; eats, shoots and
leaves...anything by wayne dyer, thich nhat hanh, isabel allende,
ggmarquez, steinbeck, malcolm gladwell<br />
<br />
movies? i love foreign films, but will also go see mainstream stuff
-- especially action movies (and especially, especially kungfu).
anything with a tall, brown hunk in it and i'm there!<br />
<br />
also a sucker for certain (altho by no means all) broadway
musicals. classical guitar concerts are the best. jazz clubs are
wonderful, too.<br />
<br />
music? i like a lot of different types: soul, jazz, some classical
(not into opera or country but i will admit that may just be
because i haven't been properly schooled), and in my attempt to
further my spanish skills, i listen to lots of spanish rock and
romantica.<br />
<br />
food? it's probably easiest to say what i don't like, since it's a
short list. i don't do raw well, so sushi is not high on the list
(sorry), and i am not into heavy sauces, so no old fashioned
french. i love most all ethnic foods -- and err on the side of
vegies rather than a lot of meat.","this is really a list of 5 of my favorite things -- and i certainly

"""i seem to be a verb"". i have always identified with this quote by
the great buckminster fuller. the full quote is: ""i live on earth
at present, and i don't know what i am. i know that i am not a
category. i am not a thing  a noun. i seem to be a verb, an
evolutionary process  an integral function of the universe"". in
addition to highlighting the fact that i am a sucker for
existential rumination this quote encapsulates a more general
approach i have come to take towards life: life is change, a
mystery, an ever mutable form whose true nature is fleeting to
those who ask it to stay put, to fit in a category. stop asking so
many questions and just live - if i had to adopt a motto, that
would be it! that being said, i've chosen to make a living asking
questions and i think mottos are a bit one-dimensional.<br />
<br />
i'm living my life as richly as possible. so far i've met many
wonderful people from whom to learn from and share this time, and i
continue to be surrounded by them in this amazing place that is the
bay area. i'm certainly looking forward to meeting many more,
especially those who are ""mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be
saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never
yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn"" ;)<br />
<br />
i am dynamic, intellectual and passionate. i value the freedom to
think, to live and to continue to explore this world in a healthy
and energetic way. along the way i hope keep making friends, keep
having fun and hopefully find a partner that can keep up with me!","getting paid to be a big nerd (at the moment i'm finishing my phd

food: most. especially if it has garlic. or ginger. or both. and
noodles. man, i love noodles. i'm an omnivore but have been
becoming increasingly less desirous of meat and more picky about

vegan/healthy/local/alternative eating choices as a real part of

viewing them as strange forms of self-denial.<br />

"i am looking for a partner, friend, lover and soulmate.&nbsp;<br />
about me. &nbsp;i never know what to write myself...about me, i am
a very active, loving, caring and wonderful individual. &nbsp;the
truth is, i can write anything i want but only you can say if its
true or not and even then it would be debatable because is very
opinionated. &nbsp;i consider myself to be a very loving, giving
and caring individual. &nbsp;i am very active and try to live an
active lifestyle. &nbsp;my hobbies are to rock clim, kayak (white
water), paintball, scuba and camp. &nbsp;i want to get into
backpacking and hiking in the bay area. &nbsp;i have never been a
snow person but i am interested in learning how to snowboard, and
ski. &nbsp;i moved from the east coast to the bay area in january
and am looking to make friends and potentially find a soulmate.
&nbsp;i am looking for a partner in life who can share my passions,
lifestyle and everything in between. &nbsp;i am looking for someone
with mutual interest where we can communicate.<br />
&nbsp; i feel that communication is key and the basic foundation
for any relationship wether is friends, partner, business or
anything that involves more than one person. &nbsp;without good
communication, a relationship can be malnourished and lost. &nbsp;i
am looking of a partner to improve my life as i will do hers.
&nbsp;someone who is kind, with good feelings and that cares about
her body as much as i do about mine. &nbsp;i eat healthy, and i
workout everyday. &nbsp;i am not shallow, but lets be honest, if
you don't like what you see at least a little, its very difficult
to feel complete. &nbsp;prove me wrong, im willing to accept when i
was wrong. &nbsp;i am willing to compromise, to listen, and to
sacrifice as long as is mutual. &nbsp;a relationship should be
about communication and respect. &nbsp;should be about sharing
sacrifices, success, failures, about having someone to depend and
trust on. a relationship should be willing and giving. &nbsp;there
are so many more things that i feel i should put here, but hey, if
your interested just drop a line and we can chat a bit...<br />
what i want in a relationship. what i whant is to be able and have
deep meaningful conversations about our plans. about what want to
do with our lives and were we see ourselves going. to have the best
of communication becouse i believe that communication is the true
center of every relationship (being &nbsp;it being friends,
business or love). but at the same time i whant to feel that magic
of lust and atraction mixed with love and the desire of being
together. i believe that a combination of the perfect amount is the
recipe for the best relationship. &nbsp;how about sharing a great
deal of those feelings while camping, either in the city or in the
woods, in a boat in the ocean or in a beach at the coast?a weekend
trip to tahoe or vegas, or a vacation to another continent wether
it be europe or australia? all while learning our goods and bad,
while having ups and downs in life and in business.<br />
<br />
about my type of girl. she would be a go getter like me. she has to
have dreams, aspirations, plans and a great desire to be
successful. she has to like the outdoors, the indoors and
everything in beetween. she has to be active and willing to work
hard for her body, her man, and her future with that man. to be
able and be sophisticated while conducting business and while need
to be, but to also know how to be wild, free, and crazy at times.
must poses a great heart and be willing to look out for others when
need to but to have the balance and know when to say no. in full i
am looking for a strong girl who will fight for me as much as i
will fight for her because we will fight together.&nbsp;<br />

i grew up outside of boston, but have been in sf for a few years. i
thought it might take a while to embrace ca and the lack of
snowy-slush in february, but all it took was one february of
people-friendly weather. accustomed to the new england edge (slush
will do that to you), it was somewhat of a shock to see strangers
help tourists on muni. turns out it is also somewhat of a shock to
see muni arrive when it says it will, but that is neither here nor

upstairs telling me that the tops of those same desks i watched be
loaded into a truck has mysteriously appeared outside their office
door. ...what??!! how??!! i have no idea. i can imagine only two
scenarios. either the guy who picked them up drove back to the
office when we weren't here, broke into the building, and carried
two heavy wooden table tops back up two flights of stairs for no
apparent reason. or they homed like migratory birds back to the
office they had lived in for so long. i hate them. make them go

finding a cool girl that i can find companionship with.",i'm in my twenties living in san francisco...,i hate mustard,you want to.
"hello! i live &amp; work in sf. my friends would describe me as
being funny, smart, fashionable and clever. i love travelling and
exploring new places.<br />
<br />
i have my favorite hangouts and i'm trying consciously go to
different places--as there are so many spots right at my fingertips
that i haven't been too. i have a lot of interests--- film,
fashion, enjoying the outdoors, travelling, reading and the list
goes on &amp; on.<br />
<br />
since i work in marketing, i like to keep my copy short. this is
all i have to say for now. :)","i work hard, write a fashion blog, help my friends + family, and
like to have fun. like everyone else in their early 30's, i'm
trying to take care of business and enjoy life!",driving &amp; parking in sf. that is not an easy task. woo-sa!,"i know this sounds really cheesy, but my smile.","i love the book ""city of thieves"".<br />

"i'd say i'm pretty down to earth and laid back. i have a good sense
of humor, love to laugh and am generally pretty positive. i work
hard and get alot out of my career, but like to take just as much
time to have fun and enjoy life. i love getting outdoors and
running, hiking, kayaking - always looking for new adventures.","working as a nurse. taking time to build and enjoy the
relationships in my life. always looking to learn new things (like
bikram yoga), explore new places and improve on myself.","planning vacations. listening to friends/loved ones and providing
support when needed. board games. smiling and laughing. enjoying
... whatever it may be ... if that makes sense.","well, probably my hair, but then also i think my good-nature and
kindness.","books - i mostly read 'drama'-type books and memoirs - the glass
castle, angela's ashes, anything by pat conroy.<br />
movies - mostly comedies and dramas. my favorites include grease,
into the wild, shawshank redemption, the notebook - i could go on
and on!<br />
shows - i like to watch snl , a couple of dramas on tv, jimmy

artists.<br />
food - i really enjoy cooking at home, and am pretty open when it
comes to food. i like going to a hole in the wall, a greasy spoon,
but also enjoy going to some of the nicer restaurants in the city
on occasion. i especially like mexican, japanese, and a really good
pizza.","connecting with friends and family - relationships in general -
(i'd like to add partner here)<br />
sunshine<br />
spending time around water (oceans, lakes, rivers)<br />
keeping life interesting and fun","how to create a life and environment that is positive for myself
and those loved ones around me. and it's not just about me and
those i know, i want a better life for my community - and through
my work and volunteering i'm able to contribute to that.","i don't really have a typical friday night. often i stay home and
relax by cooking dinner and watching an on-demand movie. i also can
be found out watching live music, going to the movies, a sporting
event, the theater, or out to eat with friends.",hmmmm...not sure about this one yet.....,you would like to get together so we can get to know each other.
"i like sports more than anything else in the world. i look feminine
but am not a dumb broad that can't handle her own. i'm quick
witted, intelligent, beautiful, well traveled, a phenomenal
cook,selfless, kind, fun and funny (there is a difference). i'm a
threat ;) i love my life and each day that i live it gets better.
the only thing i look for in a man is that he has good hand eye
coordination, he's not a complete loser or tool, he's intelligent,
funny and hygienically sound.<br />
i would like to find someone who is secure with themselves that has
achieved something in their life yet looking to set goals each day.
i am motivated and the energy and fun loving spirit i have always
ignites those around me.<br />
<br />
if you can't talk sports, you might as well not even bother talking
to me. my life revolves around the game when i am not working. i am
actively engaged whether it be physically, mentally,
conversationally or visually with sports everyday. i'm really
sarcastic and love to joke and have inappropriate fun, but i am
serious about my career and education. i do not handle immaturity,
rudeness or crass behavior. ""you only get one life, live it how you
want to live it."" i'm just livin' the dream.","living every minute of it... working, school, family, friends,
solid social life, traveling and being adventurous.","anything and everything with the exception of math ;) i can pretty
much grasp anything you throw my way.",my awesome personality and my eyes.,"i love to read... i enjoy all types of movies and going to the
movies. all music and concerts...food i'll try anything.","espn, my family, my friends, my dog, cell phone and car... but
honestly i think shelter, food and personal contact are a close
runner up sequence ;)","work. unfortunately... or what i am going to get into after i get
off of work","doing something... whether it be a night in the city with a group
of friends, a seedy hole in the wall bar, lounge in sacramento or
spending time with close friends with wine and some good old board
games.",ask me...,"you feel like we would have fun hanging out. if you are a wet
blanket or ridiculous... don't bother.<br />

"i grew up in the bay (5th generation marin!) but just moved to sf
last winter after about 6 years in nyc. the transition ""back home""
was/is harder than i thought but i'm really happy to be getting to
know this place in a whole new way.<br />
<br />
despite having lived in and loved some major cities (madrid and
lima, too), i'm beginning to suspect i might be more of a country
girl after all. i derive a huge amount of satisfaction from manual
labor and homesteading type stuff. i'm a little old-fashioned in
certain senses, but am very liberal in my approach to other people
and find most of them (truly) fascinating and fun. i value
self-sufficiency and whatever the opposite of squeamishness is in
both the physical and mental realms. i'm an experience seeker and
i've collected many, but am hoping to add a larger dose of
stability to the mix now. whatever that means.<br />
<br />
jesus, this is boring. okay, how about: lately, i've been thinking
about summer fruits, hot rods, japanese embroidery, butchery, bread
science, homemade hooch, my dog's haircut, hanging plants, knives,
old age, canning, money, new york, livestock, running, boating,
swimming, camping, road trips, pastry, etc. that might all change
tomorrow, but probably not.","i settled in sf sort of accidentally. i had taken an extended
hiatus from brooklyn to spend time with my parents while i
considered job offers in the uae and on a boat, and it suddenly
seemed like this was the place to be instead.<br />
<br />
i am a cooking school pastry chef, a restaurant cook and a private
chef. lucky for me, it's all intertwined and i don't have to pull
18 hour kitchen shifts anymore. i get to design, write and teach
cooking classes, create recipes and cook in a variety of amazing
settings and i am very grateful to be where i'm at with my career,
though always eager to be doing 'more'. e.g., i'm also helping some
friends with a ranch in mendocino get their retail meat thing
going. i'm learning how to butcher (and slaughter!).<br />
<br />
i have a lot of control over my work schedule so i'm making a
serious effort to do more traveling. mostly mentally, so far. help?
rediscovering california is way fun and i've got friends spread out
all over the place who i love to visit.","well, food. and i pick up languages easily and have a dorkily huge
love for english vocabulary and all that. food and language are
very closely related in my mind.<br />
<br />
also: organization, re-messing, embroidering, doodling,
macgyvering, playing off frightening ailments, saying exactly what
i mean, analyzing, seeing the good, jumping in the deep end,
multitasking/getting distracted, growing plants, enabling,
aggrandizing, cheering, [verb]ing<br />
<br />
i am undeniably really bad at math and things involving numbers
that i can't convert in to a picture somehow. i just tried to
picture ""math"" in my head and my eyes may have crossed.","i'm sure it's that i'm tall. unimaginative louts. or my hair... it
changes often.<br />
<br />
oh, i have two black script tattoos. the one on my forearm seems to
be off putting to certain folks who have specific ideas about
femininity or class or whatever else. if you're that sort of folk,
i do believe we're too sensitive for each other. but you might not
notice that first.","lists of names are pretty damn boring, right? i like most of the
usual stuff that all you other liberal, coastal, impulsive
dilettantes like. besides the cataloging of one's favorite things,
apparently.<br />
<br />
i do have a notable, nerdy love for scifi and fantasy books, movies
and shows. i have a crapload of food-related books, of course, and
i will eat anything (non-human) at least once and especially if it
has sriracha on it. i'm just beginning to cultivate an appreciation
for classical music, and i don't own a tv, though i do have the
internet (see?).<br />
<br />
if you insist, i can provide you with some names - i'm pretty much
only ornery with open-ended, robot-generated inquiries, promise.","1) something to look forward to<br />
2) good food<br />
3) time to think<br />
4) the ocean<br />
5) newness<br />
6) love","as much as i love to paraphrase myself, i'll just refer you to the
above.",i often lose track of which day it is. so... this is awkward.,"i used to be vegan. i own a mets cap. i'm scared of fish. i might
give up a kidney. my natural hair texture is wild curls. i sort of
love 'fessing up to 'private' things.","you have something to say about something i said. did you know that
people send out apb messages like 'hey girl, ur hot, i'm a great
guy looking for a real woman, let's go on a date'? i'm
paraphrasing, but no lady likes to be treated like female #00345 or
whatever.<br />
<br />
and you're a nice guy with reasonable communication skills. not
rebounding or rebelling against your usual type, please.<br />

other than that, you should just message me. i don't know what to

appreciate anyone who's willing to spend time with another person

allows for a very casual way of introducing others who would
normally never run into each other."
"so... here goes. i'm a pretty active, ambitious person who has
finally come back to the bay area after living on the east coast
for several years. i couldn't be happier being back in california
and am looking for someone who enjoys the same things i do-
traveling, hiking, exploring the area, movies, etc. i'm pretty
career driven and work in politics. but all work and no play is no
fun and i'm looking now to spend more time than i have in the past
getting out there and enjoying what san francisco has to offer. i
think what makes me unique is that i'm not afraid of anything and
am always up for a challenge. i moved to new york and washington dc
because i've always loved those cities and am not afraid of putting
myself in a difficult situation. i'm super social and enjoy
grabbing drinks with friends, checking out a local art show, wine
tasting, and anything else that comes up along the way. i'm very
close to my family and enjoy seeing them pretty often, as they are
all in the region. i consider myself to be a genuine person who is
true to my word. i'm looking for someone who is intelligent, caring
and motivated. and please come with a sense of humor, life is way
too crazy not to laugh.","as of right this second i'm working for an elected official
handling everything from policy to day to day operations. i love my
work, primarily because i enjoy making a difference in people's
lives. i'm kind of an idealist like that but don't get me wrong, i
don't think i'm going to be in this work forever, we can talk more
about that later. who knows what tomorrow will bring but i'm
ultimately looking for a career that allows me to make a decent
living while doing my little share to make the world a better
place.","putting people at ease, nothing like a good conversation to talk
someone off the ledge (well not literally, that would be a little
crazy).","probably my blue eyes which i can't take credit for, thanks
grandpa!","books:<br />
poisonwood bible is my absolute favorite, otherwise i'm more of a
magazine/newspaper person- new yorker, ny times, and a little us
weekly just to mix it up!<br />
as for movies, my most recent favorites from the oscar lot are
probably the descendents and the artist. as for tv, i'm addicted to
dexter and am just getting through season 2 of breaking bad. it's
amazing<br />
when it comes to food, i'm always up for everything. i enjoy thai
and japanese as well as italian.","my huge box of photos that i've collected from travels around the
world, my running shoes, coffee, my car (yes, i said it, after
being carless for 8 years i freaking love it), a great bottle of
wine and dare i say, my i-phone, after years of holding out i
finally got one after my ancient flip phone died in costa rica, now
i'm hooked. yes, apple has brain washed me too.","i think a lot about my career- what i want to do next, accomplish
in five years, etc. we live in an amazing place with so many
options, the sky's the limit. i'm fascinated by what's going on in
both national and global politics and am a super wonk who reads the
ny times often. and, of course i'm always thinking about where i'm
traveling to next!","either relaxing with friends over drinks or chilling at home- it's

"i'm a frenchie who's moved here at the beginning of the year after
spending six years montreal. i really love this city (it might have
to do with the positively delightful absence of snow), and i'm
looking to make friends (and possibly more) to enjoy it with.<br />
<br />
otherwise, i'm zen, easy going (though no complete pushover) and
curious about everything... my philosophy is that in most cases, i
prefer regretting having tried something than regretting not having
tried it. up to now, it's served me well...","i work as an artificial intelligence developer for a video games
company, which shows that you can be paid to do amazingly cool
things, and while being a bit of a geek is part of the job
description, that doesn't mean i'm not social, quite the contrary.

places. fun lies in variety, not routine!","- picking up new hobbies<br />

music: an eclectic selection ranging from classical to hard rock.
i'm currently learning the piano, and i love swing dancing, so i'm
partial to those sorts.<br />
<br />
food: i'm a foodie, so it's hard not to say ""everything""... i'm
also a pretty good cook, or so i'm told. my latests experiments
involved dabbling with the so called molecular cuisine.","the most obvious ones don't tell you much so i'll drop down a rung
or two on the ladder and say (in no particular order):<br />
- travelling to different countries<br />
- my camera<br />
- biking / hiking<br />
- internet (essential when your family is 6000 miles away)<br />
- some creative outlet (right now, my piano and the iphone game i'm

villains who have the passion and the drive to change the world

fight to preserve the status quo. and who can stand a mr.

tidbit: i've never joined facebook and it feels good.","i've spent most of my twenties wanting to be anywhere but here and
now that i've collected many pretty stamps in my passport, i've
settled upon the lovely truth that my family will never leave
california, and i truly love being near my family. so instead of
running to catch a train to destination anywhere, i've come to
appreciate being still.<br />
<br />
what is still? you may ask.<br />
<br />
still is unexpectedly loving where i live in oakland. it's
searching for the best glazed old fashion donut or dancing in my
kitchen to motown. it's challenging myself to wake up early for a
bike ride, but knowing i have a weakness for warm blankets on cold
winter mornings. still is buying another pint of beer, and buying
another round for my friends as well.<br />
<br />
still, for me, is setting little goals along the way, like reading
a book a month or learning how to use power tools even though i'm
really kind of scared of them. it's indulging in a marathon weekend
of television catch-up or a two hour brunch over bottomless cups of
coffee.<br />
<br />
still is the thrill i get, when riding a bike down hill. as i
mentioned earlier, i've come to appreciate being still.",talking to strangers.,i ask questions.,"my past year includes:<br />
david copperfield, archer, party down, aretha franklin, jens
lekman, the beautiful things that heaven bears, emperor of
maladies, natsuo kirino's out, simon and garfunkle, west side
story, skippy dies, community, mandopop ballads, hall &amp; oates,
mixtapes with frenchpop, long form journalism, and asian dramas

unfortunately i fell out of the habit of reading literature a few
years ago at the onset of the decline of my vision.<br />
<br />
i'm less interested in visual arts at this point than i thought
possible, remarkably. i used to be consumed.<br />
<br />
i'm a bit out of touch with tv and movies. i liked the kung fu
series. one of my fave movies is dersu uzala. i like costume drama
in general,<br />
<br />
i like beautiful music, old fashioned played on real instruments.","i've lost many things, but never hope",transient beauty,cultivating my interests. avoiding crowds,"i suffered a crisis of ethics several years ago which led to my
walking away from my career.","you are beautiful, kind and kind of rugged. i prefer a man that
requires less grooming than i do. you have a high code of honor and
good manners."
"i'm pretty straight forward. i like having fun and enjoying life.
funny things are good too. i love music and am pretty open about
what i listen to. i like being active, snowboarding, skating,
biking, driving fast in my classic 73 karmann ghia, exercising,
rock climbing and adventuring. on the other hand i like relaxing,
drawing, photography, playing retro videogames, making music,
mostly guitar and drums, creating things, and living in the moment.
i try to appreciate life daily.","this summer i've got a fancy job in palo alto, so thats exciting.
during the rest of the year i'm going to college for graphic
design. on the side i'm trying to further my drawing skills, and my
musical ability so i can maybe go somewhere with either of those
things. those are my biggest passions.","im pretty good at talking to strangers, and being spontaneous.
other than that nothing really, i'm okay at a ton of stuff, but
only okay.<br />
<br />

solving problems (i like to think), making and telling jokes, and
keeping an open perspective.","""this guy's crazy, but i guess he's funny.""<br />
<br />
thats my guess anyways. i try not to live for others. its funny
because although i am pretty out there, on the inside i think i'm
pretty well grounded and logical.","wow, well this is about the most vague question ever. i do not know
where to start.<br />
as far as music goes, i like all genres except country blues and
opera but there are always exceptions. . . as far as the bands that
i like to name a lot: deathcab, badly drawn boy, the foo fighters,

<br />

<br />
as far as tv i guess i like funny cartoons like adventure time,
regular show, family guy, robot chicken, and stuff like that. . . i
also like comedic live action shows like scienfeld, and how i met
your mother. . . and old 80s shows are the best, like doogie howser

is free, if friends are free i will hang out with them, if no one
is free i'll occupy myself with a hobby.","pretty much anything, i dont really have a private thing, its kind

can be too open.","you are passionate about art, music, or culture. or if you want to

i'm a jeans and t-shirt kind of woman. my style is funky but
chic.<br />

i am an artist... jewelry design, metal smithing, ceramics, mosaic,
painting and drawing. i am also a jewelry instructor.<br />

balance in my life is a top priority. i make time for myself,
family, friends, and my dogs. i love to laugh and to make people
laugh. i love an interesting, intelligent, deep conversation. i eat
healthy, meditate and exercise daily.<br />
<br />
i love to travel and have been to europe, eastern europe, israel,
canada, and much of the us. my healing spot is kauai and swimming
with the turtles soothes my soul. i long to go to kenya (to meet
the aids orphans and destitute women i help with the sale of my
jewelry), the galapagos, and bali.<br />
<br />
at my house there is almost always music playing. i play several
instruments, none of them extremely well, but well enough to have a
good time. i play djembe and dun duns with my drummer gurlz weekly.
we just recently started performing and it's a blast!<br />
<br />

face, dogs in the back... tails wagging.","i feel like i have been given a second, or maybe third, chance at

happening. i have a positive outlook on life and i'm excited for

rid of so many these past few months, and i'm trying to lighten my
footprint. books can really weigh a person down.<br />

movies are great (both at home and at the cinema) and provide a
great escape. too many favorites but my all time favorite has to be
lifeboat by hitchcock.<br />

digital hacker/developer (learning). and a culture hacker and the
founder of cyience which is in its early stages but will hopefully
be quite influential. i highlight the cyber renaissance which is
bridging the gap between art and technology. i believe that founder
should have the same merit to young people as rockstar or
celebrity. i believe in making geek chic. i want little girls to
grow up to want to go to science camp and to possess scientific
superpowers. i believe in a world where people become robotic
engineers and fashion designers.<br />

they can eventually lead a much more advanced and sustainable
society. our triumphs are fundamental and hope that our failures
won't be repeated. i believe in green technology and preserving our
echo-system. i hope for increased life expansion through technology
and innovation. i am a hybrid between the geeks and the consumer
population. i learn from every being i encounter and want the best
for every individual. i understand the beauty of the universe and
wish to create influential art. i hope to save the world by

my favorite english teacher once told me that this quote was the
perfect description of me.<br />
<br />
""if personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then
there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity
to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those
intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles
away. this responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby
impressionability which is dignified under the name of the
""creative temperament""-it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a
romantic readiness such as i have never found in any other person
and which it is not likeley i shall ever find again"" (fitzgerald,
1925.)","godel escher bach, the cyborg handbook! the guide to cyborg

energy: how we as a society can continue to consume energy
(although less would be better) without extracting potential energy
from the earth and converting it into kinetic energy. this is the
root of our energy problems, imho. we need to begin to capture
kinetic energy as it travels to and about the earth (e.g., solar,
wind and tidal power). the difficulty comes into play when you
consider how to store the energy in order to deal with fluctuating
demand. kinetic energy must be harnessed and used in the present
moment. otherwise, it must be stored (converted into potential
energy), which is comparably more difficult and costly.<br />
<br />
what makes people who they are and how i fit into the world. i used
to think i was anything but mainstream until i asked my last
girlfriend what she knew about woodstock, to which she responded,
""what's that?"" i then asked if she knew who mick jagger is. she
said something to the effect of, ""the name doesn't ring a bell, but
maybe if i saw a picture, i'd recognize him."" i showed her a
picture of sir jagger (yes, he has been knighted), and she didn't
recognize him. i then realized that i was probably a lot more
mainstream than i had thought.<br />
<br />
politics: healthcare reform, election reform (how about
proportional representation instead of first past the post?),
energy policy, smart growth, privacy in the digital age... after a
friend of mine badmouthed the clinton bush haiti fund (for what i
thought was no good reason), i went ahead and gave them a
donation.<br />

money comes from? if not, the truth might surprise you
immensely.<br />

which impending doom is going to strike humanity first: post peak
oil, lack of water, global warming, a massive worldwide economic
depression, or some other fate that i have overlooked. not that i
believe in fate anyway =p.<br />

while. so perhaps i'm sleeping! perhaps i'm not.",sunny side up -- yolk broke.,"i'm a banter. rer. so if you don't want to be banted at, dun

"i'm an enfp, a social big-picture emotional creative soul.<br />
<br />
i see most things in shades of grey. i can be often indecisive
because i really want to give merit to both sides. (politically,
though, i know where i stand. leftleftleft)<br />
<br />
so, i see the world as fluid and shifting constantly... and i
occasionally long for absolutes. i've determined my own truths but
challenge them often, and i'd actually love to hear yours.<br />
<br />
most of the time, i really love people. i'm very passionate and
definitely appreciate passion in others as well. i'm fond of the
earth and try to be good to it. i don't have a lot of enemies, just
missed connections, and my friends tell me i'm really lovable. try
out and see what you get.","right now, spending time in the work-world. i work with kids as an
in-home support counselor and with young adults at a shelter. i'm
looking to work to become a therapist once i have a more clear path
in mind.","talking to people. smiling. being oddly creative. enjoying food,
thinking on the spot. creating harmonies, adding to music, making
connections, fueling love tanks.","well, hopefully they look at me and see someone who really sees
them. but if not to that level, they probably think that i'm pretty
friendly... maybe a wee charming","i'm an avid comic book reader and buy more nearly every week... big
x-men geek, have been my whole life. not too big on cinema, i do
really like glee, 24, project runway (though, like you, i was
definitely anti-gretchen) food is one of my favorite things, i love
asian food in particular, but i'm also a sucker for french fries.
i'm a vegetarian and really appreciate being one, but have no
problems with others' habits. oh and music. music is probably my
favorite thing. i love rihanna and am falling in love with dev, i
love good dance and some steps-away-from-the-norm pop.","good food. good music. good friends. a good cuddle. a good project.
the feeling of causing good.","can i continue to explore myself as an independent entity while
forging new intimacy with someone else?","relaxing at a friend's house, talking, drinking, playing games.","i think trader joe's peanut butter cream cheese is delicious.
that's not private at all. i'm answering this superficially because
i'm pretty much an open book, and can't really think of anything
more private that should go on here.","you've got something to say.<br />
<br />
most people, including myself, just send messages that say a basic
greeting or emphasize on a commonality, and sometimes ask a
question. i dare you to be bolder, go beyond that."
"i'm a thoughtful and affectionate person with a big heart and
curious mind packaged in a slender body. i thrive on connection
with friends, my family and a partner. my 8 year-old son lives with
me half the time. i'm a creative professional with a business i've
owned for many years. i've lived overseas and traveled a fair
amount and i now appreciate the roots i have in the bay area.<br />
<br />
i'm playfully cerebral and interested in the layers beneath the
layers but i'm also content to enjoy simple pleasures and what's
happening in the moment.<br />
<br />
i'd like to find a co-adventurer with a good intellectual appetite
and curiosity. it helps if you've faced your own demons (the
majority of them anyway) and are engaged in something that feels
gratifying. you like sharing planned or spontaneous adventures and
enjoy a resourceful and curious playmate.","playing many roles as i raise my son while keeping my life as an
adult stimulating and full. i love exploring the world and figuring
out ways to make a positive contribution. i have an entrepreneurial
nature so i'm often thinking up new projects. i started and ran a
non-profit for at-risk young women in my 40's so that desire to
really make a difference is an inherent part of my being.","making up fun adventures.<br />

reading bestsellers (unless they're about neuroscience) but i enjoy
a wide variety of artistic expression. i grew up with a classical
violinist so classical music is in my blood but i love many genres
from folk to opera.<br />
<br />
i read voraciously and idiosyncratically and as little on a screen
as possible, though that's difficult.<br />
<br />
i'm a ted fan. what a great gift.<br />
<br />
i love fresh- baked things but for real food i generally eat veggie
and a variety of ethnic food. i could probably live on lasagna. you
can't go wrong with ricotta cheese. i'm a big fan of fresh
fruit.<br />

things i'm passionate about and less on silly life tasks.","having some kind of adventure. it might by having dinner with a
friend, building something with my son; wandering around the
oakland art murmur, curling up with a book, or planning something
fun for the weekend.",i think this is more fun as pillow talk.,you feel an inexplicable desire to do so.
"i recently moved to the bay area from seattle (lived in portland
for a while too). i'm pretty happy to have moved here, as seattle
was boring me to tears. i can imagine moving to nyc, but the cost
of living and competition for good housing just scares me, frankly.
in a lot of ways the east coast culture feels more my speed, but in
some ways not. i do love the
in-your-face-tell-me-exactly-how-you-feel nature of folks
there.<br />
<br />
i have an insatiable appetite for novelty and learning. it's very
my nature to seek and explore new things just so that i have
something new to learn.<br />
<br />
i don't own a tv by choice, too much violence and garbage. i prefer
to selectively stream what is interesting to me via the internet. i
stay fairly active via recreational dance and i am an absolute
walkaholic! i love to walk long distances in quiet neighborhoods
around and ponder...stuff. i wish there were just more time in the
day to get from place to place via walking alone.<br />
<br />
when it comes to attraction, the eyes really have it. other
physical features matter as well, obviously, but the eyes give a
lot of information away. they are indeed the window to the soul. i
like to laugh, so a shared sense of humor is very important to me
as well. i really can't imagine a relationship thriving without
that a good shared sense of humor.","i really enjoy the things that are coming out of the maker
movement, and enjoy visiting makerfaire's around the country
whenever possible. i find it to be a very meaningful way to
learn/explore/engage with the people in the local arts/tech

<br />
learning, experimenting and generally enjoying my free time. i am
currently working as an engineer for a large company, (working as a
geek, such as the market dictates) but have ambitions to take a
sabbatical at some point in the near future.<br />
<br />
the kinds of things that interest me are more like that of an
amateur anthropologist. i enjoy deciphering human behavior in it's
social context as well as wondering how well marketing effects
people's behavior. there is a lakota saying: ""pay attention to what
catches your attention"". which i take to mean that things that
strike a person as beautiful or interesting have a deeper meaning

-from my house, i am within 15 minutes of the great outdoors in
three different directions. can we talk about how awesome that
is?<br />
-the food scene is alive but the after hours scene is not which
means many people go to bed early (and then get up early), like
me.<br />
-we are close to (but not in) silicon valley: a technology-driven,
entrepreneurial environment that has a ""anything is
possible""attitude. close to but not in means i don't need to live
in the suburbs. that's important to me.","oh gosh, another big question. my life feels full and fun. i'm

intellectual desire for better balance in my life with my innate
desire to just roll with it.","yesterday was pizza and meatballs at beretta. on the friday before
that, i was barefoot in tulum, mexico eating fish tacos. and on the
friday before that, i watched an hour of geek foodie television and
then went to bed. i think before 9. wow.","i put sparkling water in my white wine. it's trend-setting. just

focusing on work and career to get to the point where i feel
comfortable with my knowledge and experience and happy to get up to
go to work everyday. now i think it is the time for me to meet new
people, make new friends and ultimately to be with someone with
whom i can continue to explore this life in a new dimension.<br />

i admire people like bill gates, mark zuckerberg a lot since they
are very motivated, intelligent, and most importantly, they are
self made billionaires and the contribution they've made to the
society. i like to hear and read stories about these successful
individuals and it motivates me to reach my goals in life. yes, i
spend a lot of time thinking about how to be successful in my life,
define my own definition of what it means to be successful in life
and whom i should look up for. i want to be rich, but not for
myself. i understand having too much money does not mean that i am
going to have a happy life. however, in order to help people, i
need to help myself first by being successful in my life, and then,

i'm super into cussing. i think i'm pretty damn lucky, and i think

me?","i really like flipping things in pans when cooking. i like to drink
beers at bars and go on walks that people think are too long. i'm

swell.)<br />
<br />
i have a 9-5 job that i like and am good at. it's one of those

work with puzzles/basements)","making delicious beer and pretty good thai food. if i'm not good at

hummingbirds. identifying plants and animals and pointing them out

at holding hands and word games, but i'm pretty good at making you
laugh even when you're pissed, and then demanding we get the hell
out of here, even though sometimes we're at home, and then we get

bookshelves. you'd hate it. you're very busy and smart. still, here
are some authors, because that's fun: oe, mishima, murakami, abe.

bowles. hickey, zizek. i'm also super into achewood, xkcd, scary go
round and overcompensating. i think my sense of humor is pretty
much buttercupfestival.com.<br />
<br />
movies - i don't really watch movies? but i like lynch, pt
anderson, documentaries. bubba ho-tep is pretty incredible. so is
brick.<br />
tv - nothing surprising here. arrested development, twin peaks, the
wire, mr. show, daily show. the venture bros are awesome. i just
finished watching avatar the last airbender, and it was
excellent.<br />
<br />
music - i dig angels of light, indie crap, dose one, old country
music, and then a whole hell of a lot of instrumental shit to write
to.<br />

food - if it's there, i'll eat it. if it's thai or indian i'll eat
even more of it. i don't think i've paid for italian food that
wasn't pizza since i tried to impress girls at high school
dances.<br />

we'd do if the doctor told us we'd have to give up coffee or
alcohol and just pick one. we'd have a very hard time. my family's

peaks.<br />

yell at me about jews. they're kind of like audible bathroom stall

outdoors",my next adventure,out with friends or working late,im afraid of the dark,if your ready to have an adventure
"well this is a new thing for me....i am an east coast transplant
and have been out here for 4 years and love it. i am an adventurous
one and love to always be doing something new and exciting; but
also like to keep it simple. i love the outdoors from tennis, golf,
hiking, biking, camping, etc. i am a woman who is looking for that
guy to explore the unknown and share in many of lives adventurous!
. i am not one for the clubs or bars to meet that one special
guy....","i am recreation programmer working for a special events company and
love what i do..","i am really good at many sports, wine tasting, cooking, making
others laugh and what i do with my life. i love the simple things
and love to surprise people with random gifts...","well being only 5' would be the first thing, but then they notice
my hair and smile! i have been told many many times that i have the
best laugh and it makes others laugh!","i love to read and have no specific book! movies are my thing and
one of my favorite past times, i also love music and shows. i love
to cook and yes i am very good!","there too many things that i can't live without and the list goes
on and on...but i will give a little sample:<br />
1. family<br />
2. friends<br />
3. tennis racquet/golf clubs<br />
4. down time<br />
5. cooking<br />
6. going out and about","i spend my time thinking about what i will be doing next and what
kind of adventure i can do...i also think about my family and
friends.","a typical friday night depends upon what mood i am in...i can
either be home watching movies, reading, hanging with friends or
out and about having dinner or dancing or catching up with friends.",i will tell you when we get to know each other :),"you feel that you and i have a lot in common and are up for someone
that loves life and adventure!!"
"these are the things that fill my thoughts and free time these
days:<br />
agriculture, what is gastronomy (see slow food), crafting (such as:
knitting, sewing, cross stitching, paper mache-ing, costume
making), bicycling about town, reading books about eating well and
farming and zen, researching ag study/training programs, baking
kale chips (among other delicious semi-experimental cookery),
planning my future.<br />
<br />
i also spend some time practicing my ukulele, and am trying to
spend more time hiking and camping.<br />
<br />
i like to try new things. living in san francisco has been a little
overwhelming for the sheer volume of opportunities. i don't need
such a variety, but it has been inspirational. there are a lot of
things i love about this city though, such as the quantity of
bicyclists, all the green spaces, the beach, delicious food, good
beer, and biking home through the park when the fog is rolling
in.<br />
<br />
here's what sounds good to me for someday in the future: building a
simple little home to live in, growing alot of my foods-including
raising some animals- working within my community to help all have
access to quality and local foods and educating people about why
that is important, exploring the outdoors on camping/backpacking
trips on occasion, having a good dog or two, and creating beautiful
things-crafts, clothes, food, landscapes, etc.<br />
<br />
i am curious, adventurous, and a dreamer.","i'm trying to find the best way for me to be happy, fulfilled, and
feel like i'm going something positive for humanity. i spent a
couple years in japan and now i'm living in san francisco. i have a
job and its fun sometimes and pays the bills but its not my
calling. i want to work with food systems and agriculture and i'm
working on it. i want to do good in the world. i want to live a
healthy, happy life close to friends and the natural world.","being positive and optimistic, dreaming, making lists and plans,
appreciating others, and making things that are delicious.","my hair and how it tries to go in too many directions; the bright
colors i'm wearing; that i wear dresses 95% of the time","here are some things that i thought of:<br />
<br />
books: the mysteries of pittsburgh, the sun also rises, 100 years
of solitude, ham on rye, the wind up bird chronicles, the engineer
of human souls, the fool reversed, trout fishing in america, the
rapture of canaan, ender's game, choke, survivor<br />
<br />
movies: when harry met sally, lost in translation, casablanca, pulp
fiction, wet hot american summer, as good as it gets, toy story,
high fidelity eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, waking life,
miyazaki films, the artist<br />
<br />
music: mates of state, paul simon, she &amp; him, frightened
rabbit, jens lekman, camera obscura, feist, dylan, shugo tokumaru,
thao, mumford &amp; sons, of montreal, dave bixby, mum, broken
social scene, muse, the fiery furnaces, ben folds (five), rilo
kiley, the magnetic fields, the weakerthans, queen (but
specifially, mr. fahrenheit)<br />
<br />
foods: most foods that are quality. i love japanese, mexican, thai,
and italian foods especially. i am working on becoming a great cook
and making good progress.","memories, color, books, curiosity, changing seasons, my sisters","what i'm going to do in the next few years, what sustainability is
and how i can better pursue it, whatever book i'm currently
reading, what fantastic meals i want to create next, how i can make
the world a better place in real and concrete ways, what craft
supplies i need for my next project, how i can get more involved in
local urban agriculture, how i can spend less time commuting to
work and more time soaking up sunshine.","talking with friends over some drinks, researching something random
online, cooking up a delicious meal, working away in my craft zone,
reading a good book, watching a good movie, skyping with people in
other time zones, relaxing in a hot bath with some tunes, sometimes
just over-napping, et cetera.",i'm going grey.,"you are playful, adventurous, curious, and passionate about
life.<br />
<br />
you are willing to work hard to build solid and strong
relationships in your life, and enjoy the process.<br />
<br />
you know that this is only a small slice of who i am, and a skewed
one biased by my own thoughts and interests of late. the process of
getting to know one another could likely involve a lot of laughing
about how we tried to represent ourselves to the internet
world.<br />
<br />
and for the record, do not message me for hookups. i'm in it to win
it.<br />
<br />
above all, stay honest and stay kind."
"im an easy going guy that likes to laugh and smile. i'm quiet
and<br />
sometimes shy, until you get to know me. i treat others the way
i<br />
would want to be treated. i do like a bit of regularity in my
life<br />
but often do spur of the moment things. i can be stubborn.
the<br />
simple things make me happy which makes the amazing things that
much sweeter. i'm afraid of complex carbohydrates and hospitals. i
love sandwiches (3 parts meat, cheese and amenities for 1 part
bread), and am a firm believer that everything is a sandwich. yes
even soup can be a sandwich - soup in a bread bowl! i like to
be<br />
intellectually and physically challenged. hockey games are the
best<br />
live sporting event. i love football. i keep score (a book)
at<br />
every live baseball game i attend. its a tradition i got from
my<br />
dad. i'll talk random sports stats to anyone whether they are<br />
listening or not, my beer and i have had some lengthy debates
over<br />
gaa and sv% for this reason. i'm goofy, i daydream, i can be<br />
sarcastic, i like history, reading and learning, i have
horrible<br />
grammar, i like geometry and architecture. friends are the
family<br />
we get to choose. my best friends have called me reserved, the
gift<br />
that keeps on giving, and frequently call me 'special'.<br />
<br />
if you got this far... i sort of dislike the online dating thing...
id much rather meet in person to talk and see who you are. looking
at profiles on here feels like interviewing someone to be my gf.
just saying... rather meet in person and find out we're not what we
thought rather than straight up dismissal. i dont know you and you
dont know me. just saying.","i work at a very fast paced social gaming company as an artist. i

i've recently started taking my health more seriously than i have
been, so i'm currently trying to lose all of this weight that i've
gained over the last few years.<br />
<br />
i've started exploring the regional park here in crockett recently,
and although it's freezing out, the beauty of this place really
makes it worth the hike.<br />
<br />
i absolutely love to go camping, and i try to go at least once or
twice a year. my favorite places to go camping are all in northern
california: burney, lassen, and crescent city. i've never seen
anything as beautiful as fog flowing between the redwoods in
redwood state park.<br />
<br />
i'm what some people would call geeky. i'm an information sponge. i
would much rather watch a documentary than a work of fiction.<br />

i'm also a bit of a gamer, although not as much as i used to be. i
love board and card games, especially ones from independent
publishers.","i'm currently working with cancer patients at various hospitals in

identifiable and distinguished ""part"" of society despite knowing
the deprivation this might entail. deriving satisfaction from a
sense of protection offered by membership to the delusional mass
seems dismal and potentially unavailable for a queer. on the other
hand, i'm giving credence to the desirous human animal that i am
and am working to embody roles that satisfy and express what i
want. i can only speculate that the effects of this on others will
be recognition that i am interestingly ordinary. maybe
unpretentious forms are precisely the who's i aspire to be.

doesn't suck.","helping people feel better. dancing. being thoughtful, direct and

<br />
i love music. listening to it, dancing to it, singing it. it's a
big part of me. historically i have pretty eclectic tastes,
garnered from music &amp; dance camps and raves in the 90s/00s. so
everything from classical lebanese music, nerdy afghan tunes to the
cure and scandinavian electropop. i like ella fitzgerald a lot too.
some other stuff in my 'pod: royksopp, bonobo, arcade fire, ray
lamontagne, be good tanyas, black keys, manu chao, iron &amp; wine,
habib koite, thievery corporation, franz ferdinand, little dragon,
jose gonzales, npr, kpfa, kalx, and on occasion some really dirty
hip-hop. i also have a soft spot in my heart for brazilian drumming
(samba, etc.) , as i studied this and played a range of percussion
for years","good friends, laughing, eating good food, good sleep, connection,
growth, fun, hard work (at something), chocolate, my dog, learning","people's motivations. which country i would like to go to next.

"wondering why so many people view my profile and so few say
anything. i have to admit that i do the same. i will go to a
profile, read it, realize there is one criteria that i don't fit
and move on in fear of rejection. i just wish more people would at
least say hi, or you sound cool, or you have a cute face, or at the
very least tell me i look like the myth busters guy (i do get that
a lot in public).<br />
<br />
well, i'm not really sensitive. i just figured i would play with
aliteration in my description.<br />
<br />
i love to travel, check out art usually at a smaller gallery rather
than at a museum, music, especially live music, cooking, camping,
hiking, exploring the city, and enjoying good food with
friends.<br />
<br />
i also love me some heavily tattooed women. i love tattoos myself
and just haven't gotten a ton yet. i just have one. i do plan a few
more over the next couple of years. in fact i know what i want for
both sleeves, completely different designs and plan to start the
1st one, the colorful one in the next few months. this one will be
a japanese design. the other one will look like native american
(not tribal). if you saw the film ""the fountain"" it will be modeled
after the one in that.<br />
<br />
the type of woman that i typically like is a pretty broad range. i
love the girl next door look, but i also love women who have a bit
of an edge to their look. i am predominantly attracted to brunettes
and redheads, i love hispanic and pacific islander women, blue and
green eyes, tattoos, piercings, etc. i also tend to like women with
curves. now, personality is so much more important, so please feel
free to reach out to me if you find me interesting. looks are only
a small part of things and looks fade over time, but a personality
is always there.<br />
<br />
from my facebook profile:<br />
i am a walking contradiction. although i believe in the teachings
of karl marx i work in the most capitalistic industry in the world,
advertising. there are other things as well that my friends could
expand upon.<br />
i like the avant garde, mind expansion, counterculture, world
religions, social contract theory, ecology, and climate
change.<br />
<br />
i am smart, sarcastic, and sensitive.","i just recently moved back to the east bay from sf (alameda) and am
trying to reconnect here. i have a feeling it will be a stepping
stone as my goal is to get back to the city. i work in advertising
and love it. i love being surrounded by intelligent and creative
people. i am always looking to expand on my knowledge and have been
contemplating either taking a few classes here and there that focus
on photoshop and illustrator so that i can eventually get into the
creative side of advertising or i have been thinking about going
back to get my mba or law degree.<br />
<br />
i also am interested in community planning and development and
would love to get more involved in my community to try to improve
it for everyone. try to work on a sustainable plan to help the
homeless since no one seems to care about them. i saw a girl the
other day who just looked like she was fairly new to the streets
and i talked with her and she had just lost her job, her
unemployment wasn't enough to cover her rent so she was evicted. i
just wonder how long it will be until she succumbs to drug
addiction.","having fun and not taking myself too seriously. i am also good with
numbers, as i better be since i am an analyst.","my eyes, glasses, and hair color.","from my facebook profile:<br />

"hanging out with me is <i>a lot</i> like doing so with a labrador
retriever. like the lab i'm sorely lacking in worldliness, devoid
of urban sophistication and by no means the
sharpest-knife-in-the-drawer. on the other hand, i compensate with
a good-natured core that's easily amused and ready to scramble on a
moments notice. you can easily steer me towards any desired
destination, but gimme the lead there's no telling where we'll wind
up. i respond well to simple suggestions like ""walk"", ""drink"", or
""eat"", but if you mention anything along the lines of the symphony,
fusion cuisine, or post-modernist art you'll get little more than a
puzzled look and a quizzical tilt of the head.<br />
<br />
i'm better at listening than talking, gravitate towards
neighborhood and/or dive bars rather than trendy lounges, and
prefer deep one-on-one conversation rather than chatting sparsely
amidst a big group. more blue-jeans-and-cotton-hoodie than sport
coat and slacks, and craves half-pound burgers rather than haute
cuisine. savors life's simple pleasures while (usually) eschewing
costly indulgences. i keep a low profile, avoiding excessive
attention while giving a wide berth to people who thrive on it.
commonly found in the company of the elderly, the married, the
rich-of-heart and the poor-of-spirit yet noticeably absent from any
assemblage of the young-and-the-beautiful. i truly enjoy
socializing with mankind, despite having what charles bukowski once
described as ""a terrible itch for solitude"". half latent child,
rapt with simple pleasures, natures wonders, and the inner workings
of all things mechanical. half wizened curmudgeon, still subject to
whims of the flesh yet mindful of natural laws regarding foolish
actions and unforeseen consequences. logical and pragmatic on the
outside.....but deeply introspective and emotional within.<br />
<br />
and lastly, despite tending a lowly spot on the economic totem pole
of the snazzy neighborhood wherein i dwell (noe valley, if you're
curious), i never cease to be thankful for what i have, what i do,
and for the fact that i get to live in this most <i>kickass</i> of
cities...<br />

- i am a mechanical engineer (n3rd) and artist-ish
(crazy-ish?)<br />
- i love a finely crafted porter, stout, whiskey or bourbon.<br />
- i am a sucker for cello<br />
- i love cooking &amp; baking, but i hate doing the dishes<br />
- the happiest feeling in the world is sitting in the sun with
someone i love<br />
- i am competent in a range of dance styles, including ballet,
bhangra, and breakdancing...<br />
- i have an irrational fear of moths, due to their chaotic flight
paths<br />
- i can sleep through anything except for periodic noises (e.g. i
won't hear the garbage truck, but i will go crazy if the tap is
dripping... and then i will fix it by any means necessary, usually
duct tape)<br />
- i get turned on by the scent of vanilla and tangerines, but
cilantro makes me nauseous<br />
- i am currently infatuated with karen o. and jhameel<br />
- i have random fits of patience, wherein i can make 100 origami
stars or finish a really good book in one sitting<br />

down to a short description. a noteworthy quirk is that i have a
fondness for film music (hans zimmer and jerry goldsmith are
celebrities to me).<br />
<br />
i read books (or listen to audio books) regularly, even if not as
much as i would like. i read both fiction and non-fiction.","internet access - my gateway to the world, without which i am
blind. an occupation that feels productive, rewarding and
contributory. an alarm clock, or else i would be mis-aligned with
society.","life, love and the universe.<br />
<br />
i think about how others perceive me, and worry about stupid
mistakes and misunderstandings of the past.<br />
<br />
i think about what the future of humanity will look like. the
probability of encountering intelligent extraterrestrial life. are
we forever bound by the speed of light? it is looking likely, but
what a shame.<br />
<br />
i think about the nature of consciousness and whether or not i am
likely to see a sentient ai in my life-time. if i do, i look
forwarding to seeing the general public dealing with associated
moral and ethical implications.<br />
<br />
i think about how one could improve society for everyone by simple
optimizations in everyday life.<br />
<br />
i wonder what will happen over the next few tens of years with
respect the general public vs. corporations and bureaucratic legal
systems that do not know how to keep up with technological
development.<br />
<br />
i think a lot about the optimal balance between individual freedom
and limitations of the same for the purpose of a global good. i
think about how most potentially very good governmental strategies
fall down due to the practical limitation that people almost never
live up to theoretical standards on which such strategies depend.","friday night is not necessarily different than other nights. i
would rather not go to parties because i don't like loud noisy
places because they make it hard to talk to people.<br />
<br />
it used to be that i would be catching a movie or doing computer
gaming with friends, but that became a bore and now i try to do
other things. that can include going out if other people are so
inclined.","i can be very shy in certain kinds of situations, to the detriment

many new places as possible.","making banana bread, listening to and understanding the needs and

"let me give you the cliff notes on me, and then you decide if i'm
worth responding to.<br />
<br />
the basics:<br />
<br />
i'm 34 years-old and a bay area native (yes, we actually
exist).<br />
i live in lower pacific heights. i'm the one guy in the
neighborhood without a dog, baby carriage, or investment banking
job.<br />
my friends describe me as witty, kind-hearted, creative, and a
bunch of other positive adjectives.<br />
<br />
random facts about me (in no particular order)...<br />
<br />
i run my own business - promoting restaurants, events, and happy
hours in san francisco. my job keeps me very active in the local
scene, so i'm looking for someone who can keep up.<br />
<br />
i'm not a marina boy - so you won't find me wearing a baseball cap,
a college t-shirt, or hanging out at the grove pretending to work
on my computer.<br />
<br />
i'm not a mission-ite - so you won't find me wearing a hoodie,
riding a road bike, and drinking blue bottle coffee (while making
fun of people in the marina).<br />
<br />
i don't play in a band; i don't surf; i don't rock climb; and i
don't have tattoos.<br />
<br />
i've never in my life received an email that actually made me
lol.<br />
<br />
i'm not a fan of movies that want me to believe cameron diaz and
kristin heigl have a hard time getting a date.<br />
<br />
i don't like rap. but if i was a rapper, i think my name would be
special k.<br />
<br />
i couldn't pick a jonas brother out of a line-up. and i don't
suffer from ""bieber fever.""<br />
<br />
i''m allergic to cats. because of this fact, i will never think
your cat is cute. sorry.<br />
<br />
things i like:<br />
<br />
a good sense of humor and irony (and not the alanis morrisette
kind).<br />
<br />
trying new restaurants around town (a nice perk of my job).<br />
<br />
i love tennis - i play in a league and belong to a tennis club in
marin (don't laugh).<br />
<br />
i recently started doing pilates and i kind of love it (seriously,
stop laughing).<br />
<br />
i really love traveling (as cliche as that sounds), and wish i
could do more of it. i've been fortunate enough to live in germany
and france, and vacation in thailand, australia, new zealand, costa
rica, europe, and the north pole (ok - that last place was a lie. i
just wanted to see if you were still paying attention).<br />
<br />
i love movies (i was a screenwriting major in college). if i was
trying to impress you, i'd tell you that my favorite movie was
""cinema paradiso"" or ""citizen cane."" but the truth is, i'm a sucker
for ""the goonies"" and ""anchorman."" i liked the movie ""inception,""
but couldn't for the life of me explain to you what it's
about.<br />
<br />
who i'm looking for...<br />
<br />
i like a woman to be sophisticated, smart, sassy (and pretty much
any adjective that begins with the letter ""s""). someone who has a
zest for life; enjoys socializing; trying new things; and isn't a
debbie downer.<br />
i like a woman who's up to date on current events but will also
understand me when i make a tommy boy reference.<br />
<br />
looking for someone to challenge me; spar with me; laugh with me;
and call me out on my b.s. when i'm acting like a jack-ass.<br />
<br />
my promise to you...<br />
<br />
i will never wear socks with sandals.<br />
<br />
i will never roll my eyes when you get excited about the new
""twilight"" movie.<br />
<br />
i will always be a gentleman and treat you with respect.<br />
<br />
so if any of this long-winded profile sounds remotely interesting
to you, please shoot me a line.","i do marketing/pr for restaurants in the bay area. i also have a
fairly popular nightlife website/e-newsletter called city dish
(www.sfcitydish.com), which highlights restaurant promotions, happy
hours, and other fun stuff around town. i hate calling it a blog,
because a blog sounds like something you cough up. but if you're
looking for a good place to eat, drink, or play in the bay, i'm
you're guy.<br />
aside from work, i'm trying to achieve balance and harmony in my
life. i think i'm ready to find a partner in crime, and see what
crazy adventures we can get in to.","i'm really good at retaining useless pop-culture/movie information.
i'm also quite good at tennis and getting into the heads of my
opponents (trash-talking is truly an art form). i'm actually a
decent writer (i was a screenwriting major in college). i'm a
pretty good swing dancer (i'm always a hit with the 80 year-old
women at weddings). i'm actually an adequate cook (even though my
job forces me to eat out a lot). and i seem to be pretty good at
writing long-winded descriptions about myself in the third-person.","people seem to notice the hats i wear. some folks refer to me as
the ""hat guy."" not sure how i feel about that, but that's how it
is. people also seem to comment on my eyes a lot (they're sort of
hazelish/green).","favorite tv shows: lost, mad men, scrubs, daily show, colbert
report, rescue me<br />
<br />
favorite movies: raiders of the lost ark, goonies, dazed &amp;
confused, before sunrise, john hughes flicks from the 80s, empire
of the sun, cinema paradiso, etc.<br />
<br />
favorite books: high fidelity, the stranger, biographies of famous
people.","1) friends<br />
2) blackberry<br />
3) tennis racquet<br />
4) email<br />
5) comfortable shoes<br />
6) clean underwear","why i am here on this earth? what do i have to contribute? how can
i help other people? why do they call it the pottery barn, when
there isn't any pottery and it isn't a barn? why are women are so
freakin' obsessed with their cats?","tennis and margaritas on friday evening. and then i usually head

"i've taken a bit of time to ponder the effectiveness of okcupid's
extensive questionnaire and came to this conclusion. i think
they're doing a great job in trying to find you a partner. but when
it comes to finding love, 300+ questions about your likes/dislikes
isn't going to achieve that goal. as for me, on any given day, a
cute smile will trump comparable cultural beliefs. show me a sexy,
worked-out body and the match/friend/enemy ratios flies out the
window. i doubt that there's any intelligent gay man on this social
website that would disagree with this assessment. love is much more
an art, than a social science. regardless, it's fun and worth

someone who enjoys being treated with respect and caring...<br />
<br />
my interests are pretty varied- i love to swim, garden, cook and
bake, walk in tilden and in my rockridge neighborhood, local stuff
like street fairs and farmers' markets. i work out at the berkeley
y to keep my bmi less than 25! i spend a fare amount of time
maintaining my vacation rental- people visit from all over the
world and have a real home in which to stay. i actively maintain my
garden, which i designed myself after taking out the front lawn
years ago.<br />
<br />
i'm retired from my career as a financial planning educator- i
taught in many east bay adult schools and at the community college
level for many years. i found it to be satisfying because i felt i
made a positive contribution to peoples' well being and
security.<br />
<br />
back in the '60s and '70s, i was a self supporting artist and
finally earned my degree in studio art 10 years ago. i took classes
while still working as a financial planner- and swam for the cal
state hayward [now east bay] swim team when i was 47...i'm
certainly not a jock now, but was the oldest ncaa athlete in the
country at the time.<br />
<br />
i look forward to taking a few trips- and am definitely looking for
a travel buddy. my style is pretty low-key- staying in smaller
local places and eating local food. now on my proverbial 'bucket
list"": paris and giverny, budapest, prague and cuba.<br />
<br />
my family and friends tell me i'm a good cook, which makes me happy
because i love to do it...and having a special someone to share and
cook for is something i look forward to.<br />
<br />
i'm looking to being in a long-term, sensual relationship with a
man who has a flexible schedule or is retired.","i joined the berkeley y, shop at berkeley bowl a few times a week
so that i can cook for my family and friends. walking my dog in
tilden, pt. isabel or just in my neighborhood, tutor reading,

the best...really. i just saw '1968' at the oakland museum- very
sobering and beautifully organized and presented.","conversations- i'm a pretty good listener and i'm curious. i like
to think i can hold my own on more than a few subjects and am
interested in your thoughts and opinions. i'm an adventurous

am a pretty decent swimmer...",maybe my smile?,"rereading 'the four agreements' and it feels like the 1st time.
also reading a grisham escape novel, but enjoy more thoughtful
stuff as well- i recently finished the marriage plot by eugenides.
i just read 'it comes from berkeley'- a wonderful read about my
home town. i love vietnamese food, especially after spending some
time there a few years ago. i am a member of the oakland museum and
try to get into the city to see shows and galleries a few times a
year. the annual classic movie series at the paramount is lots of
fun, too. as you can probably tell, there is a theme here... i like
to take advantage of local, neighborhood events as well. so street
fairs and farmers' markets are something i enjoy, the latter being
a starting place for a wonderful meal!","calling the bay area home<br />

for me is to make each day count. that could be deepening a

ride that fine line between charming gentleman, and mercurial
shithead, obviously, leaning towards the latter. i am loyal, to a
fault. they're probably a few friends in this digital petri dish
that will attest to that, or, at least, until i get my forty bucks
back. i swim, play softball, and make a general half-assed effort
to put my shit away. i love anything inappropriately funny and
served on a stick. death metal, stonerdom, and nerd cultural are
like warm blankets to me, but i am neither a burnout or overly

time, i help run the night crew of a dance club/pizza place, 20% of

education when the economy will let me do so. i'm a retired party

it's like you are pre-dooming a relationship or a discrete way of
saying wanting casual sex, no?<br />
<br />
moi: i have a love for music, body modifications(piercings,
tattoos, etc..), video games, makeup(if you don't like women with
facial piercings and who wear makeup, go away), linguistics, rainy
weather, and movies; pretty much in that order too.<br />
<br />
i do not have a friend in jesus, but if you happen to, i don't

often my idea of fun is going to cafes and/or walking around with
my friends doing nothing in particular ; not much of a party
person.<br />
<br />
i can't cook, but i would like to learn. i'm very chill, down to
earth, and open minded. i wholeheartedly detest drama(and i'm not
one of those people who say they hate drama yet are surrounded by
it constantly).<br />
<br />
if you are extremely sensitive(meaning someone who becomes angered
or offended easily too), we will not get along, period. i can be a
little opinionated, moody and crass at times. at the same time i
can be very reserved, compassionate and nice...<br />

height maybe?","books: i avoid reading books unless i absolutely have to. as
horrible as it sounds, i just have never enjoyed it. in the same
breath i'm a bit of an autodidact, so i ingest a good bit of
information through other sources even though i don't enjoy
books.<br />
<br />
movies: lots..i like most movies i see.<br />
<br />
shows: the sopranos, big bang theory, the office, celebrity ghost
stories, and anything dealing with the paranormal...that's about it
i think.<br />
<br />
music: i tend to lean more towards metal, rock and alternative; but
i like a good range of other genres as well.<br />

i think i'm funny. i like people who are also funny (major bonus
points if after meeting me you determine that i am indeed funny). i
believe sarcasm is the ultimate mental foreplay and should be
deployed at all times and all costs. this of course sometimes
proves problematic with those in the population who don't ""get
it"".<br />

i own a tuxedo and a couple of very nice suits and can clean up
well when the situation requires - wedding, funeral, ballet

"this is my first time doing an online dating thing. i admit i've
always been a little skeptical of these things, but life is pretty
chill right now, so i figured i'd just give this a shot and see
what happens. i grew up in socal. then i came up to norcal for
school and have stayed here since. i enjoy hanging out with
friends, checking out new places, trying out new fun things, and
low-key hanging out/relaxing. i dont really enjoy dancing/clubbing.
probably if i had to pick a few words to describe me they'd be:
genuine, friendly, hardworking, fun but also serious when i need to
be, and sometimes childish. recently, i've been thinking about
career and life stuff.","currently in med school, applying for residency. career is
important to me, but so are family and friends and enjoying life.
this year im trying to explore all the hidden gems of sf and its
surrounding cities (mostly the nature-y places and food places),
spend lots of time with friends (med school, college, and high
school, and new friends along the way), and find some good books to
read.","sleeping<br />
exploring<br />
enjoying life's simple things<br />
wanting to try to learn new things, but never really getting around
to it","friendly, happy, down to earth, can be childish, hardworking.","books - currently reading the hunger games trilogy. the book i
probably read the most times is enders game. the harry potter
series was also awesome.<br />
<br />
movies - avatar, how to train your dragon, toy story 3, matrix, up,
dark knight, iron man, any chick flick<br />
<br />
shows - i love musicals. wicked and billy elliot are probably my
favorite.<br />
<br />
music - ummm. i like a lot of stuff, but usually not rap. i am
actually horrible with song titles.<br />
<br />
food - almost anything. really. but not a huge seafood fan.","family, friends, internet, sleep, food, wanting to make a
difference",life,"hanging out with friends (grabbing dinner, hanging out at each
others' places), visiting my relatives in south bay, or relaxing at
home after a long week",i'll think about this one...,you think we might at least be friends :)
"i have to start this by saying that i'm not so sure about this
online dating thing. having been born in the '80s, i was raised to
believe all strangers on the internet were old men just pretending
to be my age, and they'd mention no end of puppies to get me to
give out personal information or meet with them. i'm pretty sure
there's a few csi episodes that follow the same idea as well, and
that's real life right?<br />
<br />
that said, i've also been drinking wine.<br />
<br />
anyway i consider myself pretty laid-back. i'll skip the part where
i talk about long walks on the beach (though those are fine), but i
do like relaxing in parks and going to brunch. brunch is one of my
favorite things, right up there with fireplaces and a well-brewed
cup of tea. do you like french toast and mimosas? we'd probably get
on swimmingly.<br />
<br />
i'm a little adventurous and love to travel, too. i spent a few
years after graduating university working abroad; just long enough
to start pronouncing certain words oddly or adding strange
inflections when i talk. i just like going new places and getting a
little lost.<br />
<br />
on a typical weeknight i'm probably at home reading a book, but if
that's not the case i also like to go dancing, try new restaurants
in the city, or go to some music show. i'm always looking for new
music to listen to, and have pretty wide-spread (yet picky) tastes.
except for country. i have no interest in country music.<br />
<br />
i guess i'm looking for someone like-minded, interesting and
hard-working. i'm also past the point of liking the 'bad boy'
thing. if you're a d-bag, there's probably plenty of other girls to
write bad poetry about you. i also like guys who are taller than
me, capable of carrying on well in a crowd of strangers, and can
punctuate properly.<br />
<br />
but i don't know what any of this really says about me as a datable
lady.",adventuring.,"i'm kind of a jack-of-all trades, but i think i'm a pretty good
writer.","i'm tall, blonde, and very pale.<br />
<br />
i am often mistaken for swedish, even in my own country. i have
actually had someone argue with me over my nationality, insisting
that i must be from europe.","i read a lot of fiction, and anything by neil gaiman might be tops
right now. i want to be neil gaiman when i grow up.<br />

i don't watch a lot of tv, but i was really into doctor who for
awhile.<br />
<br />
my musical tastes are varied yet picky, and there's probably
something from every genre that i enjoy listening to.","i'm going to assume indoor plumbing and penicillin are a given
here, so here's just six things i really like to have around:<br />
<br />
books - and a lot of them. of all varieties. ebooks are okay, but
it makes for a pretty empty bookshelf.<br />
<br />
the ocean. i've never lived further than an hour away from it for
longer than a summer, and even though i don't visit it as often as
i should, there's something comforting about knowing there's a very
large body of water i can go look at whenever i want.<br />
<br />
music. this feels like a cliche thing to mention, but in my defense
there is something universally appealing about music. it's like
math, only it can stimulate emotions other than frustration.<br />
<br />
my iphone. i mention this less in an 'i'm obsessed with sms and
checking my facebook every hour' way, and more in an 'i would get
lost even more than i already do and would never know how to find
good places to eat' way. without google maps, i would be terrified
to drive anywhere.<br />
<br />
my desk. i'm not one of those people that can lay in bed with a
computer and be terribly productive. there's something about
sitting at a desk that says, ""time for working now."" i get things
done, with a desk.<br />
<br />
tea. some people in the city are coffee connoisseurs, and i can be
the same way about tea. many problems can be solved by sitting and
drinking a good cup of tea.",unicorns.,"i'm not sure if any friday night is ""typical"" for me, but here's
some typical non-worknight things i might be doing:<br />
<br />

-dancing it up at a company happy hour, via an xbox kinect.<br />
-grabbing dinner/drinks with friends.<br />
-reading a book and/or watching something on netflix.","i'm pretty open, but you'd have to ask.","do you have a career-like job?<br />

it comfortable. our home away from home. family is my number one
priority. one of my goal in life is to make them live a life were
they can enjoy it to the fullest. (lottery cross fingers lol) i'm
so far away from this goal and honestly most of the time i rely on

"my chronological age is deceiving. i'm loaded with energy and
actually have more young friends. i guess part of that has to do
with having a 15 year old, but i've always been very active and
athletic. i enjoy appropriately younger men who can keep up with me
but youthful men my age who are equally committed to an
active/healthy lifestyle. i work out daily, bike/hike and practice
healthy living, so i'm very fit and in shape.<br />
<br />
for fun, i love all sorts of activities - of course travel,
spending time with friends, farmer's markets, museums, theater,
concerts, dancing, foreign flicks, entertaining and cooking (used
to teach). there is very little i wouldn't do. i'm open,
spontaneous, and up for adventure. at the same time, i can be happy
reading, sitting around talking, or watching a movie and eating
popcorn on a saturday night. i'm not a tv watcher, but i can be
convinced to chill out!<br />
<br />
i've been told i'm a strong woman, independent, and low
maintenance. i can trim my own trees and fix a few things, but i'd
still appreciate someone who'll tell me to put oil in my car; stuff
like that, but i'm very much an accommodator, and like to make
everyone happy. i'm funny, good at telling stories, and openly
affectionate. you'd find me sensuous, always on an even keel,
always optimistic, and very loyal. kind of like a golden retriever,
minus the drool. sweet is probably a great description of me...
with a big heart.<br />
<br />
i recognize that any relationship has to start with a first date
and building a friendship, so i don't feel like this is a race to
make something happen, but in the long term, i want to be in a
committed relationship. i want to wake up in the morning and look
into the eyes of the man i love. what i want is a man who's a great
communicator. a man who has heart and cares beyond the portal of
his life. a man who has a passion for something in life...
something that fires him up, takes hold of his heart, energizes
him.<br />
<br />
i'm looking for a man who challenges me, teases me and makes me
laugh. a man who once in awhile gets a wild hair and says 'hey
let's go do this' even if it's unconventional or seems like the
craziest thing to do. i'm not an especially
let-me-get-my-ducks-in-order-before-i-make-a-move kind of gal.","""being happy"" would be a great description of my now. i'm a
self-employed corporate trainer and i teach public speaking. when
i'm not teaching, i'm writing a blog or spending time with my son.
giving back is important to me and i support a ""sister"" in rwanda
so she can be economically independent. when my friends and family
need me, i'm always there.","being on an even keel all the time, teaching, writing, coaching,
communicating, parenting, building relationships, helping other
people figure things out, mentoring, leadership, thinking out of
the box, seeing the good in everyone and every situation, handling
emergencies, making people feel good, being spontaneous, taking
care of my health, being intimate, being a wonderful friend and a
great girlfriend!","my smile, that my voice makes me sound taller than i am, that i
make people feel comfortable immediately, that i'm very easy to be
with, that i don't look my age and that i'm much more attractive

you.","i love all kinds of food and all music except reggae. love live

"i write songs and stories and sometimes stories about songs.
there's almost always a new album and another one in the works. i
cover the bills by copyediting for publishing houses and magazines
(but i'm not a grammar snob). i also once co-founded a
writing-focused public high school, then worked as an administrator
there for four years. a big resolution this year has been to get
back to helping kids with writing.<br />
<br />
i lived in new york, mostly brooklyn, for fifteen years. in january
i settled in san francisco, near family.","creating a confluence of prose and music, reading and listening.
launching a flurry of albums, playing with glue guns, trying to
write a thousand words a day. reading whatever book is at hand.

diagram sentences. not enough frisbee, not enough wiffleball. going
coast to coast. getting the 2012 record ready. it is the best one
yet.","operating a four-track cassette recorder. that's some old analog
home-recording junk if you're wondering. making an egg cream:
they're extremely refreshing. flipping through vinyl. being on

the flea market. i really like the flea market: in the east i
thought i understood, but alameda is ridiculous.<br />
<br />
and baseball. i'm really good at liking baseball.",the curls. sometimes i laugh loud.,"this part got a little long.<br />
<br />
books: i wish kayo books on post street was open all the time. when
i can't hang around there reading pulp and back issues of mad
magazine, i must turn to my own bookshelf and wandering little
brain. i started the confidence man by herman melville and really
liked it, but i left my copy back east and need to get another one.
i tried to read madame bovary but then i was totally derailed by a
happy days marathon from a season without richie, ralph
malf...shit, even chachi was hardly in it. i rebounded by reading
nobody move by denis johnson. then the little foxes by lillian
hellman, you don't love me yet by jonathan lethem, ask the dust by
john fante, and hotel california by barney hoskyns, which is all
about the eagles and joni mitchell and jackson browne and mounds
and mounds of blow. now i'm reading the memoir of former soul
coughing front man mike doughty, which is pretty interesting even
though every single person in it is obnoxious and i didn't even
really like soul coughing all that much. on deck are mr. nice by
howard marks, black monk time by eddie shaw, john ashbery's new
translation of illuminations...and madame bovary and the confidence
man.<br />
<br />
music: music is the most important thing in the world to me. i like
vinyl, although i've been separated from my collection here. the
recent pile, representative of my tastes only by being random,
includes shuggie otis, cutty ranks, green on red, norman blake,
mickey newbury and various other early-70s singer-songwriters (who
the hell is tom ghent? ron nagle? dennis linde? dennis linde is
awesome, that's who dennis linde is), the new feelies, eddie
kendricks, ann peebles, dolorean, andy bey, soft machine, modern
jazz quartet, rhetta hughes, m.o.p., shona mbira music, gang starr,
hotel lights, pete rock &amp; c.l. smooth. furthermore, it seems i
had long been underestimating quadrophenia.<br />
<br />
movies: i've seen spinal tap eighteen bazillion times. i'll also
watch tcm whenever i get the chance. i just caught the end of this
musical comedy called ready, willing and able (1937), with a
tap-dance finale on a gigantic typewriter. it was outstanding. (i
also like typewriters.)<br />
<br />
and food? making stuff. helping you make stuff. i'm trying to get
better at visualizing what i feel like eating, and then figuring
out how to make it. meat, veggie, whatever, but it tastes good.
perhaps it is slow-cooked so we can have some cocktails while it
bubbles on the stove and becomes what it is meant to be.","two is fine: pen, paper.","definitions of success. self-directing myself through multi-tiered,
interlocking projects.","getting all stoked about something or other. maybe catching some
music. possibly babysitting my nephews.",i want to write lindsay lohan's comeback record.,you're smart.
"i love living in san francisco, playing, loving, laughing, creating
and discovering.<br />
<br />
mostly enjoy dancing, performance, music, great food, walks and
parks. most of all, i am amazingly blessed with great friends and
great connections.<br />
<br />
there is so much to stay active with, both with work and play.
enjoy not having too set a schedule, and room for spontaneous
activity.<br />
<br />
i also make time for myself to do nothing, reflect, renew and
rest.<br />
<br />
i really enjoy affection, both giving and receiving. while i feel
very 'male', and often come across very much as a man, i also have
a soft and feminine element within that adds more of a roundness to
who i am as well as allows me to have many different perspectives.
very grateful to experience a full range of emotions, and am
appreciative for having that capacity. communication is important
to me.<br />
<br />
i am inquisitive, affectionate, and open","my work feeds my creativity. my passion and joy are filled through
close friendships and relationships, movement, dance, and
explorations through immersing in my senses. exploration and new

discover freshness and aliveness. having curiosity around
non-traditional relationship explorations whatever that means!

be the most rewarding.","friendships, finding my way, listening well, conversation, dancing

encounter.","an open, approachable presence. how i value and appreciate almost
everyone i meet, and can relate on whatever levels they are

intentions.","diva is my all time favorite movie. a french film with english
subtitles. based on a short novel by delacorta. the soundtrack is
awesome!<br />

balance, harmony, breath. oh yea ... and sushi, dance, bliss. more

or performance. its all kind of in the mix. in truth, probably
nothing 'typical'. how boring.","may come off a little shy at first. warm quickly with open
communication where there is mutual interest.<br />
.","you want to connect with warmth, honesty, pleasure, joy, a new
friend or ongoing relationship.<br />
<br />
you like to discover new experience, both inner and outer. if you
have an adventurous spirit, an open and willing heart, are in touch
with your body and can communicate feelings. if you can share
deeply of who you are in joy, tears, fear, bliss. if you can live
in the moment as if it is forever.<br />
<br />
or perhaps ... if you are simply curious?"
"i'm more of a slow burn than a flash.<br />

things i have done. ""the wtf is almost always on the other side of
tequila shots"".<br />
<br />
i love to figure out how anything works and understand its essence.
that could be personalities, social interactions, politics,
technology or personal interactions. it's really a never-ending
pursuit which fulfills me :)<br />
<br />
i'm not 100% on this online dating thing yet, but i'd rather not
date my friends or co-workers, so... what the hell :)","i'm currently figuring out how to balance the gajillion projects i
have. these range from organizing photostrolls (brunches with
friends which lead to photoshoots about town), making a documentary
for a friend's birthday, planning my next exploration trip
(baseball hall of fame with dad this summer!), putting together a
show &amp; tell evening (everyone gets up and shows what they're
passionate about, followed by q&amp;a. think ted, but amongst
friends. so far, they've been a wild success....), simply going for
a hike or chilling with mates over a brew.<br />
<br />
during the day, i'm a manager at a tech startup in silicon valley,
which i find terribly exciting. been doing that for for several
years at various companies and i'm quite jazzed about the current
situation. i love being surrounded by smart motivated, capable
people who are passionate about what they do.","i am a great person to be a mirror. i will call you out on your

before...single man looking for beautiful woman who has traveled
extensively, speaks 7,194 languages, climbs mountains on weekends,
loves to laugh and is described by her friends as the kindest,
sweetest person to ever walk the earth. maybe, just maybe, she's
spent the last six months in peru backpacking and is planning her
28th trip to italy. ok, maybe it's a bit of an exaggeration (the
7,194 languages part) but doesn't it seem like we're all reading
the same profile? why do we need match.com? aren't we all already
climbing everest? wouldn't we run into each other in nepal?<br />
<br />
part of me would feel a lot more comfortable if i read a profile
that said, ""i admit it, sometimes on a saturday afternoon i snooze
on the couch or watch tv because i'm exhausted. i don't need to
'do' something every saturday night as i'm perfectly content
hanging around at home, in my jammies, with my hair a mess, no
makeup, making dinner, having a bottle of wine and watching tv.'""
doesn't anyone watch svu marathons, chopped!, storage wars or food
truck wars? doesn't anyone get stuck going to costco on saturday
afternoon? where do you find the time to do everything you do? i
find that i spend hours at home depot trying to explain to the
check out clerk that no, i don't want to buy the orange bucket,
that i used it to carry stuff around.<br />
<br />
while i find those people who have traveled to 3,329 countries
adventurous (do passports really have room for that many stamps?),
i have to admit that i haven't done that. i do have a reasonably
well-worn passport and i've seen much of europe and some of asia
but i did most of my traveling early in my career and it always
seemed more important to sit in the back of the cab preparing for
my next meeting than taking in the sights as i drove by. if i had
it to do all over again, wisdom would have me make better
decisions.<br />
<br />
by day i'm a business, legal and travel journalist. i think that
makes me a cynic who fantasizes. i've wanted to be a journalist
since i was 15 so i'm doing what i've always wanted to do. while
covering business is straightforward, writing about legal cases can
be difficult, complex and heartbreaking. there are times when it
can also be very rewarding. my goal is to write a non-fiction book
on a topic that has yet to be determined. now there's focus for
you.<br />
<br />
in my spare time i love to golf. while this might sound schmutzy
(that's a very technical legal term) i like golf because it's a
game of honor - you call penalties on yourself and if you cheat
you're the only one who will know. it's a microcosm of life, play
by the rules and when you mess up, own it. that's me in a nutshell.
i also like movies, live theatre and music, i want to learn to ski
and i want to visit budapest (you'll have to ask about this
one).<br />
<br />
so what am i looking for? someone who is super smart, has the
courage of her convictions and is not afraid to tell me when i'm
wrong. someone who understands that writers can sometimes be
neurotic but we can also be very interesting too. finally, someone
who is willing to swing at the park and tell me stories of when she
was a little girl. if you've been to 3,329 countries that's a bonus
but i want verifiable proof that the story is true.<br />
<br />
you see, everyone has a story and journalists love to listen to
them.",i'm a journalist so i'm in search of the next great story.,"finding cheap airline tickets. ok, so they're not always for
destinations i want to go to but they're cheap. wichita anyone?",the paparazzi who follow me wherever i go.,"my favorite movies are those that include denzel washington, kate
winslet, russell crowe or michael douglas in the cast. my favorite
tv shows are law &amp; order svu, law &amp; order and the evening
shows on the food network. musically, my taste generally gravitates
to top 40. i like alicia keys, christina, maroon 5, kenny loggins'
old stuff, daughtry, rob thomas, lady a, some gaga and james
taylor. i'm not really picky about food. five star restaurants
don't impress me. i'd rather hang out at a diner and talk to the
cook while i'm eating. to me, meals are about the conversation not
the food.<br />
<br />
my reading is primarily non-fiction but i'm reading 50 shades of
grey, and just finished calico joe.","my 3 daughters, my 2 dogs and my ipad. is that 3 or 6?",where i put my keys and wallet.,either out or in. that about covers it right?,i carry my golf clubs in the trunk just in case....,"you're breathing and have a heartbeat. i have really high standards

probably says something about me.<br />
<br />
i am good to my family and my friends. i believe community gets us
through life.<br />
<br />
i am a enfp in the myers briggs personality assessment. i am a 7 in
the enneagram. and my latest interest is the chinese zodiac. i am a
wood dragon. here a is a pretty good description of what that
means.<br />
<br />
the wood dragon 1904 and 1964<br />
<br />
wood has a modifying influence and brings creativity to this sign.
questioning and liberal, wood dragons enjoy talking about original
ideas and are open to other points of view. they are innovative,
imaginative practical and appreciate art in each of its forms.
generally less pretentious than other dragons, wood dragons have an
ability to get along with other people. they have the essentials to
build a prosperous and happy life for themselves. still, wood
dragons are outspoken and at times a bit pushy to quell everyone,
even in the most friendly quarrel.<br />
<br />
yes this is mostly true about me....the pushy part too.","many things but most interested in understanding myself and others.
i want very much to make a difference with my time on the planet.
up to this point in my life i have been in monogamous relationships
with women. however, i am really working to understand myself in
relationship to monogamy,"" not monogamy""(whatever that is) and
relationship. although i find open relationships very challenging,
i have a very strong desire to understand all the feelings that
come with breaking the socialized idea of monogamy. i am curious
about how this path may develop me, enhance my life and how i can
show up in relationship in new ways that i have not experienced
before.<br />
<br />
i am doing other things too but that is the one that has me most
intrigued right now!","i am a decent cook and find it a bit of a meditation. i really
enjoy the whole process from looking up something new to try,
shopping for the ingredients and tasting the last bite. having
friends over to share a good meal makes the cooking experience even
more enjoyable.<br />
i am a good listener, in fact people pay me to listen to them! i am
very handy to have around and generally have some house project
going on. i think i really good at being me.","my blue eyes and warm smile. i am very androgynous and like being a
healthy butch woman. my friends do not understand why i get called
a man so often but being mistaken for a man is a common experience
for me, always has been. however, i enjoy being a butch woman and i
love femme women.","i am not a movie buff and don't spend much time watching them. i do
enjoy movies and really appreciate movies that make me feel
inspired, laugh or cry, provoke action or a good dicussion....those
are the movies i like.<br />
<br />
music....i like music. i will listen to most anything but probably
won't be able to tell you who i am listening to.<br />
<br />
i love most food and will try about anything for an experience. ice
cream hands down is my favorite. generally healthy, organic and
local are my preference.<br />
<br />
i like to read but don't read quickly or maybe it would be more
accurate to say i am more of a project person. one book that has
been particularly important to me is ""broken open"".","i think never is a strong word but for the sake okc .......friends,
family, adventure, a warm beach and ocean and ice cream. oh, i so
love ice cream.","life and how to live here and now. i want to make a positve impact
and i think often about to accomplish that.","that varies a lot. i think i like it that way. sometimes i work on
the weekends, sometimes i play on the weekends. i really enjoy the
variety of my life.",i am pretty open about myself. if you ask i will tell.,"if you are open to something beside monogamy and like butch women.
additionally, i am also very interested in having more friends that
are interested in sharing their experience of living a life that is
different than monogamy. i would love to increase my community of
people looking at love and relationships in different ways.<br />
<br />
i do currently have a girlfriend which doesn't mean we are married
or primary. we have a special connection and will continue to take
good care of, through agreements and lots of communication, what we
have created with each other. we i want to experience connection
and intimacy with others. i am not looking to having a hierarchical
experience. i will be present and give my full attention with who
ever i am with."

where to catch the next concert<br />
what good music i haven't heard yet or listened to lately.<br />
<br />
with regard to people, i always thought tolstoy's three questions
were a pretty good guide for how to have the best possible time,
here and now, with the people around you.","during ski season: already in tahoe, or driving to tahoe.<br />
other seasons: going out, goofing off and relentlessly promoting
the local economy for live music.","i get really into studying pretty useless stuff, such as musical
biography/history, the inner workings of micro-distilleries (aka
moonshine factories), and other minutia. for example, jake is not
my name, it was a term used in 1920s slang: jake = ok. as in ,
""everything is jake.""<br />
<br />
that, and even though we live in a fairly vehicle agnostic area, i
drive an old jeep xj whose main purpose is tahoe, and a scooter
around the city. if this matters to you (in a negative way), we
might not get along.","you wanna go to a show and dance or at least bob your head to the
music.<br />

is simple and surprising. i'm a patient and stable person, with a
penchant for saying exactly what is on my mind.<br />
<br />
i've spent most of my life either outside wandering or inside
studying. i love hiking or just sitting in beautiful places. i'm a
sucker for traveling long distances just to sit in a natural hot
spring. at the same time, i like to just sit around reading and
thinking all day long.","once upon a time i had a career in wilderness management, spending
most of my time out on a trail some where building things and
hiking. after a while i developed a strong intellectual curiosity,
and i decided to go back to school. now i'm working on my phd in
philosophy. while it may seem like quite a contrast, studying
philosophy is an awful lot like working in the woods, but a little
less messy.<br />

i recently moved to the bay area from montana. i like it here, and
would love to get out and explore the area more.","thinking, reading, teaching, writing, chopping wood, building

have learned about a person and dream up scenarios where i play
back my knowledge of her/him in slightly exaggerated ways, bringing

collecting about you, your world, and the greater universe and

<br />
--&gt; now the schpeel<br />
<br />
i grew up rural, only child, dad immigrated from germany in his mid
twenties, mom has euro immigrant parents. big (but odd) farm till
adolescence. i stayed in my home town for school, then headed from
east (dc metro) to west (sf with a few years in palo alto/menlo
park/san bruno) for good in my late twenties. general plan well
established but new ""old"" challenges continue to press for a
lifelong solution. i've been here for about 12 years now (minus
travel time, year in portland, and two winters in tahoe, including
this one)<br />
<br />
i've come to see art in everything. and music. and boundless
energy. sf bay is truly a bubble - but a sustainable bubble of
intellect, soul, and know-how that shapes its world each and every
day. i am honored to be a part of that.<br />
<br />
i am adventurous, inventive, and fiery.","i studied math, psychology, and <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=computer+science"">computer science</a> , with focuses
on ai, human computer interaction, and all things data (retrieval,
storage, manipulation, transformation, etc.) i'm fascinated by
asian culture and practiced okinawan martial arts for about 10
years, which led me to become an asian studies and early warfare
minor, yay for non tech stuff :). (my third minor was non-linear
optimization)<br />
<br />
i particularity love the confluence of <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=art"">art</a>, <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=technology"">technology</a> and <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=music"">music</a>, and am so grateful to have found a
way to view my tech and engineering skills with grace and beauty.
most of the projects i get involved in have at least two, and
usually all three components manifesting in some way.<br />
<br />
i think about building <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=software"">software</a> (currently in my head) that
will change the lives of anyone who has ever said ""i'm feeling a
bit <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=overwhelmed"">overwhelmed</a>"". every time someone
uses the word overwhelmed i secretly get an adrenaline rush around
this individual as i feel a common bond via a shared challenge. we
all have different coping strategies on how to handle (and
engage/pursue) the unending stream of opportunities,
responsibilities, desires, and goals. tell me how you do it; i'm
super interested!<br />
<br />
i'm a modeler; it defines me more than most other single words i
can think of. we are all modelers, most people just do it all
subconsciously. i'm hyper tuned to it. we make models all the time.
we have a model in our head on how a door is supposed to work, what
happens when you turn the knob, or the lock. when a person's
experience is out of step with whatever mental model they have for
(and in this case) a door, a decision has to be made. is it an
exception? does your model need to adjusted? etc. if every knob you
ever turned did not act as you would expect, you would alter your
model.<br />
<br />
i have a <a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=startup"">startup</a>
in berkeley (near the bb west) that does planning and packing for
the outdoor industry (you go on a trip, you have stuff to bring,
and you need to coordinate with other tripmates). it's also
amazingly well suited for large burningman (or other festival)
camps. we're in alpha finally after 3 years, yay.<br />
<br />
i'm currently interviewing for various job like things in the bay.

i love to <a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=dance"">dance</a>.
nothing i have found feels more alive to me than dancing in a space
where the music is everywhere and the crowd feels and reacts to
every beat. its truly a great example of the parts greater than the
whole analogy (i.e. the song itself might be great, but its
combinatorial group interpretation that makes it unique in that
moment). most of my social activity revolves around dancing<br />
<br />
i'm an avid <a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=beach"">beach</a>

also run a fun beach tournament in december in pescadero.<br />

don't complete my sentences and sometimes i don't finis<br />
<br />
my blond curly locks. i analyze everything, all the time, mostly
unconsciously. i'm easily distracted... oooooh, shiny!","books, i don't really read them! when i do, its always non fiction.
as a kid, i read books voraciously, was in all the advanced reading
classes. i just don't have the attention span for books. fiction i
prefer either as audio/visual (e.g. movie) or interactive (e.g.
game). non-fiction i'll take any way i can get it.<br />
<br />
i will say my vocabulary has suffered a bit but i like to think
that is offset by my taking the time to look up words i am
unfamiliar with (or, with spoken word, asking the speaker what the
word definition is in context). that said, if your vocabulary is
deeper than mine, please bust out a few of those words in a
sentence with some context so i can expand my oratory
horizons.<br />
<br />
i look forward to the bucket list of books to start when i'm 50.
i'm more ""article"" length based, e.g. reading wikipedia for an hour
randomly following links. my radio is locked to npr. the topics i
care most about are tech, health, food, sustainability, business,
lifestyle, and finance. geek-wise, a slew of reading sites, this
one probably being my favorite <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">stack overflow</a> .<br />
<br />
the process of getting to knowledge is as important as the
knowledge itself to me -- books (and other media) can hand stuff to
you delivered -- this argument has many ""flaws"" of course -- but,
for example, knowing how you could figure out the speed of light is
as important as someone telling you, kinda like pi, most know its
3.1415_ but could you figure a way to derive it (even if you can't
do the math)). the point is, if you are told something, you are far
less likely to discover it on your own. on the other hand, you
can't discover hundreds of lifetimes of knowledge on your
own.<br />
<br />
movies... often i like mindless action movies with thin plots and
heavy special effects, and because these movies aren't usually
popular with women, i usually watch them alone or with my guy
friends. but i can dig a good drama, indie movie, comedy, etc.,
with the right company (hint hint).<br />
<br />
music - basically i like electronic on the funk, breaks, and hip
hop side around 120-130bpm, but i can dance down to about 110,
maybe 105... and then i stop. i also am not a big fan of the 4-4
beat (house music) but can tolerate it in small doses (say a
breakdown)<br />
<br />
i stopped going to live shows a number of years ago (but i like it
and still find myself going to the occasional show with friends) i
listen to a lot of new music, and am working on a remix with a
friend (we're just starting; it's fleetwood mac's 'never goin'
back' which has no percussion so finding the places to put the
drums is harder than you think!). i exclusively use ableton live 8,
with a bunch of different synths (massive being my favorite)<br />
<br />
i track down my friends (who are performers/djs) that play the kind
of music i can groove to and that is where you will find me when i
go out. unlike nyc, we track people, not places. we don't need to
be seen at a particular place (but i do love nyc ,don't get me
wrong, i was born there!)<br />
<br />
the dj crews i'm closest to are; space cowboys, fix, nu funk
boutique, anonsalon, and heart deco<br />
<br />
food is good - most foods - healthy foods. i'm a huge salad fan and
with my salad, mostly i eat rice/pasta with lots of veggies over
some kind of spicyish sauce (i always cook). i do wish to partner
with a super healthy eater. do you love kale, swiss chard, flax,
etc? do you blend it all together? let's talk healthy food. (i do
eat the occasional pollo and pescado, but if you are veggie we'll
get along great, if you are vegan, i'll adapt so we can eat with
big smiles all the time!)","friends/community, computer, music, outdoors, my brain, passion,
bicycle (not in order)","what the fuck i'm thinking answering 1900 questions on here. the
next 50 years, how to accomplish my two goals in life, how those
goals will integrate with a long term mate, death (in a good way),

but some clubs.<br />
<br />
i also produce a number of dance events, often ones that involve
snow, or fire, or high powered fans.<br />
<br />
i'm not into spectator sports. so if a giants game is your thing,
you're on your own. i'm also not a huge fan of things where i have
to sit for a while, like plays, theater, symphonies, etc. i'm
interested; i just have a hard time sitting still (with the
exception of my computer, cause i've got at least 5 things going on
most likely at any given moment)","i change my age on here +/- 2 years to keep things
interesting.<br />
<br />
i did stand up comedy for three nights in january 05 at a
laundromat/cafe (brainwash.com) and invited none of my friends to
see how it would go. it's hard being on stage and my form of humor
is very situation. i don't tell ""jokes""! on the plus side, even
stand up failure yields to $1 pbr's and getting your laundry done.

i had a pony as a kid and could ride to the general store in my
hometown (about 30 miles from ithaca, ny). our ground was really
soft and it was expensive to get the pony's hooves cut (on hard
ground, hooves naturally wear down but on soft ground, they need
some help) so when i was maybe 10 the pony vanished, replaced by a
little 75cc dirt bike. i was both crushed and excited.

give the rest away.<br />

juxtaposed together into something that is a bit undefinable.<br />

meow, let's play!"
"19, from la, came to sf for school at aau.<br />
i'm pretty chill. i like to hang out have a good time. i'm sweet,
have a sense of humor, and can hold a conversation....after i get
over my initial shyness. though after that, i'm kind of odd. i
quote random films and songs and find humor in almost anything.",getting a bfa in film so i can have my dream job.,"being sarcastic, watching films, adjusting.",my eyes,"books: i like a good read, the kind of books that get you invested
and you can't stop reading, so you end up turning page after page
before you realize it's 3am and you have class at 8. (el alquimista
me cambio la vida)<br />
<br />
movies: even though i am a film major, i'm not snobby. i love all
different genres. i appreciate a good action flick: die hard is
forever one of my favorite films. of course i love classics like
casablanca and vertigo, but i also love comedies like the hangover
and pineapple express. love quentin tarantino. some recent films i
loved are drive and warrior. &amp; i'm going to leave it at that
because i can go on and on. and on.<br />
<br />
tv: i tend to get over-invested in tv shows &gt;.&lt; there are a
few i watch religiously. i love supernatural, psych, walking dead,
always sunny in philadelphia, glee, skins (uk), misfits, american
horror story and there are a few others i keep my eye on<br />
<br />
music: my music taste varies a lot, about as much as my movie
taste. i love the beatles, the smiths, zeppelin, alejandro
fernandez, the temptations, mana, animal collective, bright eyes,
ac/dc, michael jackson, frank sinatra, honestly it goes all through
the decades.<br />
<br />
food: sushi is my all time favorite food but mexican food is my
favorite region. though i do love a good steak or burger.","family<br />
on-line movies<br />
my phone<br />
music player<br />
my perfect pillow<br />
perfectly worn in chucks","what movie i should watch tonight<br />
just how much can i procrastinate before actually doing my hw<br />
what am i going to do this weekend<br />
when am i getting my next care package from home<br />
how many licks does it take to get to the center of a tootsie pop?","chilling with my friends, probably going on an adventure.","i can't get through edward scissorhands.<br />
i know it's a great movie but it gives me the heebee jeebees.
probably some traumatization from childhood lol","you actually got through this info and think you'd like to know me
better."
"i really struggle with these kinds of questions, but here
goes...<br />
<br />
i love my friends and my community! i think family and friends are
what life is really about. social justice issues are close to my
heart and were the focus of my studies, so they are at the top of
the list. hmmm, what else? i love music, adventure, fun, travel, so
much really...that sounds so caned, but it will have to do for
now.<br />
<br />
i am a super laid back neurotic...really i am both simultaneously,
its rather amazing!<br />
<br />
i have incredible friends, most of whom i have known for 10-20
years now, but i want more...and as i get clearer on what it is i
am looking for, it seems to be harder to find. lately i want a new
friend to share my life adventures with, all the ups and downs and
ups again! life is a journey, but journeys are always best when
shared!","i am in graduate school at the moment...i work full time in
customer service, and have an internship doing social media...so
the thing that i am best at these days is taking advantage of my
free time and making the most of it! again, sounding really
cliche...right now i am attempting to date...but i need practice!","laughing, making other people feel good, crafting, whistling,
listening, talking, having fun...<br />
<br />
this question is all wrong, it would be better to ask what i wish
to be really good at...but i guess that is a deeper question?","i tend to make a splash, and laugh...a lot!","favorites change and are always hard for me to discern because of
that, so instead here are some recent ones i enjoyed: the brief and
wondrous life of oscar wao, by junot diaz. i enjoyed it, learning a
bit about dominican history in the process. i love when fiction is
wrapped in historical fact, with a smattering of political, social,
and cultural influences...and love...that often sweetens the pot! i
also read the road recently, which i could not put down...haunting
and slightly disturbing, but i had to get to the end! over all it
is hard to say since i love so many...you will just have to come
raid my bookshelves. the teachings of don juan, one hundred years
of solitude, and a death in the family, lolita jane eyre, the
celestine prophecies, faces at the bottom of the well, the things
they carried, haround and the sea of stories, the alchemist, the
red tent, the god of small things, and so many
more...............<br />
<br />
(since i got to grad school all i want to read is trash...and i do
mean smutty, taudry, over the top supernatural romance trash, but
not twilight, like i said...dirty trash!)<br />
<br />
i love a broad range of movies from i &lt;3 huckabees to lock
stock, amelie, labyrinth, fight club, the piano, run lola run, pi,
the big lebowski, all about my mother, mirrormask, la haine, and
again many more...............<br />
<br />
music is a passion, i love all kinds like: bill withers, cody
chestnutt, lila downs, kumbia kings, krs1, nina, ella, black keys,
guru, badu, gotan project, orishas, kaki king, miles, talib kweli,
zap mama, d'angelo, shakira, the coup, led zeppelin, birdman
parker, del, springsteen, bijork, bilal, roots, ben harper,
hendrix, billie, ani, pharcyde, armstrong, jamiroquai, atmosphere,
guaraldi, outkast, marley, fugees, and i am always up for
more...i'm a toe tappin music-oholic....","i would never like to find out what i could never live without, so
instead i will just list some of the top performers in my
life.<br />
this list changes, but today it would have to be:<br />
-good coffee<br />
-npr<br />
-good friends &amp; conversation<br />
-good music<br />
-my laptop &amp; phone<br />
-good sleep...until we come around again to good coffee!","possibilities, whats next, random things...the next adventure!","what a lame question...being atypical?<br />
<br />
i vacillate between staying in with a good book, homework, or
streaming movies, to running away with friends to enjoy good
company and libations!",will not be found on an internet dating website!,"any of that sounds interesting, if you want to chat and see if we
are compatible, if you need practice dating (like i do), if you are
into meeting new people...just for fun..."
"i try to laugh as much as possible and hang out with people who
make me laugh....nothing more therapeutic than a good hardy laugh.
i've been trying to take life a little less serious lately, and
enjoy the moment and smell the roses. (=less time on the cell phone
and computer, more time on a snowboard and/or beach)<br />
<br />
love food and drink, love sports and movies, love last-minute trips
to somewhere sunny, love traveling and learning from other
cultures.<br />
<br />
i'm about as low maintenance as you'll find and my laid-back
attitude is sometimes mistaken for indifference.....but trust me,
the wheels are always spinning.<br />
<br />
i'm from here, went to high school and college in sf (usf), but i
don't rub it up in everybody's face and complain about all the
transplants from ohio and how much cooler the city used to be back
in the day. nonsense. i've moved away a few times, and i always end
up back here, so i understand how addicting this city can
be.....so, welcome everybody, enjoy! and by the way, i call it san
fran or frisco all the time, there's no unwritten rule about that,
i don't care what the cheap tourist books say.","been working in the restaurant/bar/nightlife scene for a long, long
time. went from a bar-back in college, to a restaurant gm in my
20's, to an owner in my 30's. currently in the construction/design
phase of a new, large restaurant in sf....slated to open in the
fall of 2012.",at not talking about myself.....this is torture,"i can be a little on the loud side, so you might hear me before you
see me.","movies- the departed, good will hunting, private ryan<br />
books- the people's history of the united states, anything written
by noam chomsky or gore vidal<br />
shows- no reservations w/anthony bourdain, entourage, louie,
shameless, anything on the food network<br />
music- van morrison, tv on the radio, early outkast, stones,
beasties, m83....all kinds of stuff<br />
food- yes.....yes!! and plenty of wine to go with it","coffee<br />
day-games at at&amp;t park<br />
live music and/or live stand-up comedy<br />
sunshine<br />
beers and laughs with great friends<br />
cooking","finding that perfect balance between work and play, while staying
passionate and successful at both.","laughing, drinking, entertaining, and possibly
working.....sometimes all at the same time",nope,"if ya damn well feel like it. i'm not here to tell anybody what to
do"
"hi my name is emmi. i walk this world to play music and make art in
all forms. i play guitar and some piano and can pick up many
instruments as i love music theory. i love writing; from poetry to
stories and songs etc. i'm not the stereotype of most things.<br />
<br />
i'm gender and many other things radical. im
queer(queer,poly,switch until proven otherwise). im clean and sober
but not an asshole about it. my preferred pronouns are zhe/zir but
if you're not familiar with that stuff she/her is fine.<br />
<br />
i'm often blunt and speak my mind. i believe in thinking for one's
self and that everything human breaks down to love in some
way.<br />
<br />
i'm not perfect, but i work for what i believe in.<br />
<br />
the work i do that makes me most happy is often the stuff no one
else ever knows directly about.<br />
<br />
i love everyone.....even the people i hate.<br />
<br />
i appreciate the role of contradictions in making sense of the
world.<br />
<br />
khalil gibran- ""beauty is eternity staring at itself in the a
mirror, but it is also the mirror""","i also go to california institute of integral studies and am
interested in music therapy/healing and autonomous zones. i'm
pretty political but try not to be oppressive in my beliefs.<br />
<br />
i believe that ultimately my life will not represent an allegiance
to any one specific country as all cultures contain valuable
insights.","lots of things. conversate with me, thats the best way.",my eyes are an ever- changing color spectrum.,"musically i love everything from gza to mozart. from miles davis
and thelonious monk to modern indie and rock. sigur ros and fleet
foxes as well, i also enjoy flamenco and many other forms of world
music(nusrat fateh ali kanh, rokia traore). i also love pretty
lights, mary j. blige, lila downs and beats antique. i love gypsy
music and traditional folk as well. oh and i can't forget i do
enjoy a filthy dubstep drop or two.<br />
<br />
bookwise i love bell hooks, adrienne rich, lorde, dean spade, julia
serano, thomas pynchon, david foster wallce, frijtof capra,
baudelaire, vonnegut(of course), and many others(i can't think of)
including the ethical slut. oh and great poetry is always up my
alley.<br />
<br />
movies i liked inception a lot. i like documentaries like off the
grid and we live in public. i also love spirited away and happy
little adventurous kids movies like it. : )","family, friends, being clean and sober, guitar,
intelligent-compassion, books, water, food, and love of course.","nothing. hehehe seriously it's a beautiful sort of un-thought,
thought.",reading or chillin with frandssss.,"i'm queer. i'm poly. i'm trans. i'm kinky(bdsm--domme/switch). my
love is silent but sings like a church bell.","you appreciate life....even when it's not awesome.<br />
you're open(particulary to me breaking gender stereotypes)<br />
you look past the surface.<br />
you respect my sobriety(even if you're not).<br />

you're willing to work for a good thing."

horses, broken bells, iron and wine, yaesayer, miike snow, the
shins, local natives, esthero, florence and the machine, little
dragon, phantogram, etc.<br />
<br />
books - everything from personal growth, spirituality, fiction,
business/marketing to travel stories ... unfortunately do not have
enough time to really read. atlas shrugged by ayn rand has been one
quarter complete for a year now! i have a pretty wide range.
current book in progress: book three of the dark tower series by
stephen king.<br />
<br />
food - thai and indian food! actually just food in general! i am a
vegetarian .... have been for 12 years and appreciate people being
open to trying new things. i love me some good food...","my journal, music, nature (ocean, forest, trees), my friends, my
car (road trips) and airline flights!!","how i can make a difference, impacting change on a huge level,
being the greatest version of myself and having a fun ass time
doing it all! i am a boundary pusher and introspector (and word
maker upper) which means you just never know what you are gonna get
with me sometimes.","... every day for me is an opportunity to be a work day or a
weekend day since i'm self employed. but if you wanna know what i
do for fun in general ... having long, fascinating conversations
over tea/coffe, grabbing a drink at a cool little bar, watching a
movie, going hiking, dancing, taking a road trip, seeing live
music, wine tasting, going out to a great vegetarian meal, playing
sports (tennis, golf, frisbee, bowling, ping pong, pool) ... the
list really does go on and on!",i believe in past lives! so there...,"i guess this is where i tell you what i am really looking for (so
here goes). this is a description of my ideal partner: he is a
powerhouse with a heart of gold. he is smart, funny, witty,
handsome, confident, sweet and straddles the introvert/extrovert
line. he is an expert in his field and a revolutionary. generous
and ambitious, he wants to make a big impact in this world and give
for the pure joy of being in service to others. he is spiritual,
has strong ethics, family values and is a champion in general. he
loves having fun and likes to be spontaneous. he likes dancing,
being in nature, experiencing the finer things in life and is
comfortable with simplicity as well. he takes care of his body,
mind, spirit and heart. he is open to self exploration, development
and growth. he really sees me, hears me and gets me. he knows how
to make me feel loved by giving me quality time with his undivided
attention and lots of hugs, kisses and touches. he is super sexy
and comfortable in his skin. he is open minded and open to trying
new things, whether it be sex in public or a workshop on sex! he is
grounded and grounding for me, yet has a fire in his belly and
keeps me on my toes and keeps things exciting. he does not have
kids and is unlikely to want to have kids, but is open to deciding
this as a couple. he is willing to explore the possibility of an
open relationship.<br />
<br />
so if after all that, you want to get to know someone, really get
to know someone, over a drink, a show, tea, bowling, dinner,
etc.... oh and if you want to explore the bay with someone who is
usually always up for an adventure.<br />

you find yourself suddenly awake in a dew covered field, mere
moments before dawn. a wet and tattered slip clings to you, not
because its design requires it to, but because it forgot to fall
off. more concerning than your current whereabouts is the
increasing potency of the smells of lavender and ozone in the air.
the sun and you rise together, yet you face your back to him. baby
green blades of grass cling to your bare skin where it once
pressed, sharing space with the ground. you feel the warmth behind
you as the dew evaporates and allows the minuscule hairs on the
back of your neck to stand freely and move with you and with the
wind. in the distance, from the darkness, you see two men astride
mighty stallions. they intrigue and attract your soul, but
disconcert your mind. the rest of your minuscule hairs disregard
the slight viscosity of the remaining dew and ever so slightly pull
you in every direction. a flight response wells up in you from the
depths of your belly like bile, but the soothing heat of the sun
surges forth and settles you. the riders draw closer and the fire
grows warmer. as the warmth creeps toward the unbearable, the
riders silently stop and raise right arms. the warmth is becoming a
hot white light, overcoming the breadth of your perception. just as
your perception is on the verge of being consumed by white heat,
two resplendent falcons alight upon the outstretched arms of the
mysterious riders and you have the most insane orgasm ever!"

"if the words ""poly"" or ""sex-positive"" do not describe you, you may
want to stop reading now. but, a little bit more about me and the
type of guy i'm looking for:<br />
<br />
i'm essentially a simple girl with simple goals that doesn't really
conform to usual female emotional standards. i had more details
here to embellish this point, and back in chicago this mindset was
pretty unique, but not so much in the bay. oh well. i still have
like zero sexual filter and will most likely bring up that topic
sooner than you expect. you have been warned. :-p<br />
<br />
i'm finding that i definitely prefer cute nerdy guys w/ an open ggg
mindset. and for some strange reason, the guys i tend to like the
best are almost all major bourbon lovers (even though i am not) -
strange coincidence, i know. :-d<br />
<br />
*important* (may save both of us some time) - this may not be the
best thing for a place as culturally diverse as the bay area, and
i'm kind of self-limiting my selection of the male species, but i'm
honestly just not attracted to much more than your plain ol'
trendy/nerdy white guys. there are exceptions to the rule, but for
the most part it holds true. so, apologies to all you asians,
indians, hispanics, etc. etc., i realize you're awesome people, but
if the spark of attraction just isn't there, i don't think it's
going to work out, no matter how cool you are. i'm not like some
crazy racist either (have 2 cousins adopted from africa), it's
simply a matter of attraction.","trying to get my foot in the door of the chocolate or coffee
business industries. aka, currently funemployed, but in my defense
i just graduated from one program in early may, and start another
in july. still sucks having no income though.<br />
<br />
essentially i'm trying to find my direction and passion, so that i
can create a foundation to build my life upon.<br />
<br />
bookmarking dozens of places in the bay area on yelp to try when i
have (some) more money, and until then, trying to hit up whatever
cheap/free stuff i can. sf.funcheap.com is like my new favorite
site.","*organizing things. i'm not a neat freak though.<br />
*saying ""oh bother"" when things go wrong. picked up the habit from
alton brown on the food network. who probably picked it up from
pooh bear.<br />
*sharing. in nearly all possible situations.<br />
*being shy and sometimes rather boring. think of it instead as
being easy to please.<br />
*forgiving. i'm one of those people that gets over things and moves
on in 12 hrs or less.<br />
<br />
everyday things i'm not particularly good at:<br />
*all sports, physical activities, or anything involving
balance/coordination/good timing/physical strength/endurance/any
combination thereof.<br />
*hill/parallel parking. it was all sort of theoretical when you
lived in 'the prairie state'<br />
*accepting compliments. and when i do, it's only from people i've
known for a long time. so looks-based compliments in a message you
may send is an instant turn-off. plus, it's just kind of tacky. be
creative guys. :d<br />
*whistling","tall, thin and quiet. i usually give off a ""good girl"" vibe. and
you'd be about half right, half the time. plus, i've been told that
i have a nice butt. :-)<br />
<br />
ever since chopping off my hair i've noticed that i throw my head
back when i laugh.","<strong>physical activity</strong> (i'm putting this in because it
may be a dealbreaker for some of you): i honestly don't do much.
the grand majority of my jobs have been 'stand on your feet 8-12
hrs a day' sorts of things, and the last thing i want to do after
that or on my days off is something physically demanding. the
closest thing to a sport that i enjoy playing is mini golf (which i
will kick your ass in), bowling (which i totally suck at), and
croquet (which could go either way). :)<br />
<br />
<strong>books:</strong> the sunrise lands series. anything by alton
brown. food magazines like saveur. i think i may have od'd on
reading as a kid, because i just don't seem to do it nearly as much
as i used to. update: i just bought, have started reading, and love
""a billion wicked thoughts"". next up is ""the ethical slut""<br />
<br />
<strong>movies:</strong> anything with a car chase and decent plot,
but i'm not a comedy (see below) or horror fan. i'm also a sucker
for the sound of music and any type of sports, disney, or pixar
movie.<br />
<br />
<strong>tv:</strong> dexter, unique eats, unique sweets, good eats,
iron chef america, and nerdy stuff like antiques roadshow, auction
kings and some not overly shallow things on food network and hgtv.
and again, i don't like comedy. not in a crabby 'i hate to laugh'
sort of way, but i call it overactive empathy and a low tolerance
for people doing stupid things. so when my roommate turns on always
sunny, the office, parks and rec, aqua teen, etc. i leave the
room.<br />
<br />
<strong>music:</strong> unlike most people i meet, music just isn't
that big of a part in my life. the top artists that i can listen to
all the time and rarely get tired of are: a lot of classical and
choral (not much opera though), erin mccarley, straight no chaser,

hilarious.<br />
<br />
<strong>podcasts:</strong> savage lovecast, white roof radio.<br />
<br />
<strong>food:</strong> i'm a girl of simple tastes, and usually,
the less strongly flavored, the better (i'm really sensitive to
bitter and spicy flavors). this doesn't mean i only eat boring
stuff. in chicago, i had a food buddy and would try something new
every time we went out. if i have to pick, my two fav food regions
are southern italian and new/traditional american.<br />
<br />
current food cravings: roasted bone marrow. and now that i've been
away from chicago for a bit, regional things like portillo's
hotdogs and oberweis milk. yes, milk. delivered to your back door
once a week in glass bottles.","assuming things like friends/family/basic necessities don't count,

4. unhealthy food<br />
5. warmth. seriously. you will most likely get tired of me huddling
up to you and saying ""you're so waaaaarmmmm"". my space heater is
like my most prized non-kitchen appliance.<br />
6. my glasses.<br />
7. bubble baths. i usually average one a week during the cool
weather seasons. :)<br />
8. red meat (medium rare) and my mother's gravy.<br />
9. my vibrator/porn. we're supposed to be honest, right?<br />
10. lists. despite my inability to follow the rules of this one, i
make lists all the time. usually complete with embedded formulas if
it's in spreadsheet form.<br />
11. love<br />
12. my stuffed dog, fluffy. had him since i was a kid. instant
bonus points if you have an equivalent. :)","constantly:<strong>food.</strong><br />
<br />
hourly: sex. and how i think and talk about it (especially online)
waaaaaay too much. i have the bad habit of sexting my guy friends
on a pretty constant basis. and yes, this is a bad habit because
they're usually impersonal mass-sexts that are often rhetorical
comments.<br />

school. i'm currently in the process of elimination stage.<br />

weekly: how though no matter how many times i have it, drinking
milk flavored with hershey's syrup always reminds me of sitting at
my grandma's kitchen counter before going to bed.<br />
<br />
why girls put up such a fuss about the toilet seat. guys have to
take the 1 second to lift it up, why can't we do the same with
putting it down? sure it may make the bathroom less attractive at a
casual glance, but really, girls, is it that big of a deal? oh,
unless there are like 'splashes' n stuff. i'm cool with my male
roommates, but not that cool.<br />

doesn't make it any less obnoxious.","past couple months i've been going out for dinner with a friend of

what to eat/make over the weekend.","*i think i'm totally in lust with james deen. a gentleman who is

a major turn-off. call me crazy.<br />
*i'm 25 and female, but i just don't care about sparkly
things.<br />
*though i was raised to be one (i consider myself agnostic now),
devout christians freak me out a little.<br />
*it kind of bothers me that corsets do not suit my figure.<br />
*even in my mid-20s, i still battle with my skin (birth control
helps), but as a result, i very rarely wear makeup.<br />

<br />
i just graduated from texas tech and got my ass to san francisco as
fast as i could. i'm a free spirit, a bleeding heart animal and
human rights activist, journalist, and lover of fashion and art. i
tend to attract artistic, free-spirited creative types with kindred
gypsy spirits, and i absolutely crave them in my space. i am in awe
of talented people, and strive for relationships in which we
inspire one another.","while my career will be at a fashion magazine, i am passionate
about investigative journalism. my primary issues of concern are
women's rights, animal rights, minority rights and lgbt rights,
which are a great fit with a women's fashion magazine - they get
one-two ""real"" stories per issue.<br />
<br />
i'm also really into philanthropy. i don't have money, since i just
graduated and am stil funemployed, but, i do what i can to help out
by volunteering my time, signing and circulating petitions,
contacting my representatives on matters pertaining to human and
animal rights, etc. i also spend a lot of time helping out the
stray animals in my area by making sure they have food and water,
getting them fixed and vaccinated, and often finding them new
homes.","reading people. my perspective is my gift.<br />
<br />
i am also a skilled writer, copy editor, design editor, stylist,
photographer, social media representative, literature analyst,
marketer... and whatever else isn't currently coming to mind.<br />
<br />
most people wouldn't expect it, but i'm actually a second degree,
second dan second gup black belt in tae kwon do. i'm also a pretty
good cook and a damned good baker. after a lot of work, i've become
good at honesty and transparency - hence my open book of a
profile.<br />
<br />
i'm also really good at bringing people out of their shells, making
others and myself laugh, and doing silly things that most people
are too embarrassed to do.","the warm, loving energy that i put out. also, unfortunately i find
that in our society people typically only notice my appearance. i'm
not attracted to someone's appearance as much as their mind, and i
appreciate the same from men. (read: when you message me just to
comment on my physical appearance, i think you're a pig.) also, i
have a lot of inner strength (i'm a scorpio, people) so people
notice that and are sometimes intimidated by it. you shouldn't be,
though, because i'm very friendly and warm!","i am a huge wes anderson fan, so i really dig indie movies. i also
love documentaries. a few favorites include collapse, food matters,
zeitgeist, religilous and many more. i don't dig scary or violent
movies.<br />
<br />
some of my favorite t.v. shows include bored to death, wilfred,
modern family, curb your enthusiasm, workaholics, arrested
development, it's always sunny, flight of the conchords, the daily
show, the colbert report, tim and eric: awesome show, great job,
and - i have to say it - project runway.<br />
<br />
as far as music goes, some of my favorite artists (and i could go
on all day, but, i'll keep it brief) include ted leo and the
pharmacists, built to spill, modest mouse, radiohead, the flaming
lips, beulah, belle &amp; sebastian, kings of convenience and more.
i also really dig '80s rock, reggae, blues, classic rock like the
beatles (who doesn't), zeppelin, floyd and even some occasional
lady gaga. don't hate! dubstep is another guilty pleasure - i just
love the shit out of dancing. it's great for your spirit, and for
your second chakra.<br />
<br />
the food part of this is going to make me seem like a
high-maintenance pain in the ass, but, i swear i'm not. i'm just
really into nutrition and environmental sustainability, so i eat
mostly vegan, organic, raw food. i say ""mostly"" vegan because
sometimes a girl has just got to get down on some pizza or a nice
brie.<br />
<br />
i don't have as much time for reading as i wish i did. however, i
absolutely adore anything by salinger, hemingway, kerouac,
steinbeck, shelley, faulkner, etc. i really love the classics. i'm
also obsessed with metaphysical books that help with self-work: the
four agreements, the essence of self-realization, conscious loving,
and kundalini awakening, to name a few. if we go to the park to
read, be prepared for me to read you amazing lines as i come to
them.","this is a tricky question, and will probably change from day to

with me.<br />
2: traveling - it feeds my gypsy soul.<br />
3: chakra healing - receiving as well as giving.<br />
4: friends, family and kindred spirits to play with.<br />
5: sleeping in.<br />
6: warm weather.","self-work. i'm a scorpio with a cancer moon, so, i'm an extremely
introspective person. i'm always trying to improve myself, my way
of thinking, and my connection with the divine. (by which i mean
the oneness of the universe, not jesus or some nonsense like that.)
i also spend a lot of time reading an analyzing others, and people
in general, as well as thinking about/researching economics,
politics, and the aforementioned rights issues.<br />
<br />
also, daydreaming about finishing my responsibilities so that i can
dance, twirl and play outside.","probably raging with my friends and getting everyone else on the
dance floor with my effortless freedom and sweet moves.","i've never even considered doing the online dating thing, but, here
i am. so embarrassing.","1: you're not a republican.<br />
2: you're knowledgeable about things you should be knowledgeable
about, like economics and politics.<br />
3: you smoke the ganj.<br />
4: you're not looking for a random hookup, because you won't get it
here.<br />
5: you have a proficient understanding of spelling, grammar and
punctuation. i'm not an elitist or a snob, but, everyone has
different love languages and words are very much my preferred one.
obviously this doesn't extend to friends, but, it's important for a
romantic interest.<br />
6: if you're informed enough to be down with the revolution. #ows
and occupy the world!"
"i smoke weed, play video games and manage a bead store with my
brother. i hang out with my families french bulldogs. i'm studying
mathematics.","going to school, working, hanging out with my family.","wc3, talking, cooking, reading.",i come off angrier than i am? does that count?,"buffy the vampire slayer and battlestar galactica are probably my
favorite shows, though i also really like both offices. sublime is
my favorite band.<br />
<br />
i love vietnamese, indian, korean and japanese food.<br />
<br />
for books, american psycho, the forever war, the chtorr saga. i
claudius is probably my favorite book.",i could do without anything if i had to.,"what i'm going to eat next, what i'm going to do tonight, what i'm
going to do at work tomorrow.",at home hanging out. i'm really a homebody.,"i had really bad social anxiety from 16-23. i was really cool in
high school, but that trashed my social life.","you like video games or 420. i'm really down for adventures also: i
love going to weird places and doing new things."
"ladies, are you more than just a pretty face?<br />
<br />
if you are, hello! i'm zach.....i don't like to brag about myself,
at least not about anything i can't prove lol......most guys
probably tend to tell you a million facts about themselves and hope
something sticks to the wall instead of telling you the essence of
what they're really about. people say i'm really funny and tend to
laugh whenever i tell jokes. i'm really sarcastic at all times. my
sense of humor is kind of dark and cruel, except for i love ""that's
what she said"" jokes. i like to laugh and show off my dimples! i am
a basketball fanatic, i play all lot and have been an la lakers fan
since as long as i can remember. living in the city, i like to
people-watch to see the funny dumb things people do. food is one of
my passions, i like to bake, cook, and go to restaurants and try
new foods. i really like to cook for other people, maybe i can cook
for you some time.<br />
<br />
i'm a very versatile person, i get along well with lots of people.
i can dress up (very sharp too lol) and go a social event or to the
theater (real theater, not movies) or put on some athletic gear and
hang and feel comfortable in either setting. i am an extremely
passionate person in all aspects of life. whether it be music,
cooking, or my job, i give everything i do my utmost effort
(hopefully you can be a part of this). i love a good debate, and i
love grammar. like i said before, telling jokes is another thing i
am really good at, people always seem to laugh at the things i say,
but that may just be because i'm crazy or something (fingers
crossed).<br />
<br />
like i said to start, i'm looking for more than just a pretty face.
i want a girl that can enjoy a witty, intellectual, sometimes
intense conversation. the more existential the conversation the
better. there's nothing i like more than having a conversation that
starts with noticing someone's earrings, to turning into a
discussion about the vestibular system, that ends in cracking jokes
about how much of a nerd i really am. i want someone that knows
what they like and what they are passionate about and isn't afraid
to stand up for it, but also is open to new experiences. i really
like going for random, aimless walks with no particular
destination, so if you like to do that too you get bonus points in
my book! as far as appearance is concerned, i'm pretty open as to
what i want. most women are beautiful in one way or another. i
usually do prefer taller girls (in the 5'6 and above range) but
please don't think i'll reject you if you're shorter! if you're a
flake, or someone who wants to get by on their looks alone, please
move on. that's not what i'm looking for. i want someone special
and you should message me if you are as special on the inside as
you are on the outside.<br />
<br />
my favorite quote: ""love me or hate me, at least you care about
me.""","i am working at a non-profit in san francisco serving
underprivileged youth, and going to school at sf state. i major in
exercise and movement science. i would like to join the fight
against childhood obesity some day.","i am really good at making people laugh. that is my best skill i
think. also, cooking, board games (scrabble and risk and monopoly
are my favorites), basketball, baseball, and i love debate. don't
try to get into a battle of wits with me if you are unarmed. i am a
pretty competitive person, so i like doing things i can beat
somebody at.","i wear bright, outlandish clothing a lot so people probably notice
that. sometimes i spray-paint my shoes. i usually start off most
conversations with some kind of joke in order to try to make a good
impression too. and of course they notice that i am very good
looking, right?","i am a music lover. my favorite contemporary artist right now is
kanye west. i listen to queen all the time too. i also like
ratatat, and a lot of '70's soul music. curtis mayfield, otis
redding, marvin gaye, sy &amp; the family stone, i could go on
forever. however, i like old rock like creedence clearwater revival
too, so my musical taste is all over the place.<br />
<br />
i am a harry potter trivia champion. if you don't believe me, ask
me anything about any of the books! george carlin also writes
awesome books. right now i spend more time reading my school
textbooks more than anything else, trying to impersonate the good
students!<br />
<br />
i love to cook, so any kind of food is good with me pretty much. as
long as i can learn how to cook it. i love baking so anything sweet
is my favorite. i am a root beer aficionado also!","music - i always have my headphones on when i'm out in public....i
go crazy if and when they stop working so i always carry a backup
pair or two<br />
<br />
candy - any and all kinds of candy make me happy. if i were forced
to choose a favorite, it would be nerds.....or maybe gummy
worms.....or peanut clusters....or chocolate covered gummy bears.
or maybe i really just love all kinds of candy.<br />
<br />
bacon - i love candy and we all know bacon is the candy of
meats.<br />
<br />
proprioception - i trip one time every day for some reason. but i
never fall because my proprioception is so impeccable. or does the
fact that i trip every day mean it is bad?<br />
<br />
basketball - loved the la lakers since i was born, and don't plan
on apologizing for it any time soon. i love playing the game as
well, and it's the best sport other than hockey to go see in
person.<br />
<br />
a pancreas - i wouldn't be able to break down starches or emulcify
fats without it. i love the little guy.","life in general, and hypocrisies of society. also, cooking, my
work, basketball. what my acceptance speech would be like if i ever
won some big award like a nobel peace prize or something. how badly
i wish the ending to the harry potter series wasn't such a letdown.
everybody should have died!","cooking! or going bowling, or looking for a place with an open pool
table. which i have found by the way! otherwise relaxing at home
most of the time. this doesn't mean i don't like going out though,
i definitely do enjoy going out. for some reason i just don't seem
to get around to it as much as i would like when school is in
session.......","well you have to ask for that don't you? really though, i admit
that i always say exactly what is on my mind, no matter what that
subject may be. i'm not one to mince words.","like i said earlier, if you are more than just a pretty face. i
want someone who's just as pretty on the inside as on the outside
and i can't emphasize it enough.<br />
<br />
you realize that when a girl messages a guy it pretty much
guarantees her a date if she wants one (sarcasm).<br />
<br />
you are willing to meet in person!!!<br />
<br />
and if you can actually explain what it is that makes your sense of
humor sarcastic, other than the fact that everyone seems to say so."
"generally fun and easy going, my day isn't complete without at
least a smirk. while always serious enough to work hard for what i
want, i still find it hard to take myself too seriously. certainly
direct at times, but i remain ever sensitive. sincerity and
thoughtfulness drive my actions, but i'm not afraid of a little
controversy.<br />
<br />
making time for the great things in life is important to me:
friends, family, and hopefully you. experience has taught me that i
tend to know at least a little about a lot of things--usually just
enough to get me into trouble.<br />
<br />
these days you'll find me cracking wise and making you <a class=

reading, reading, reading--such is the student life.<br />
<br />
yes, yes... just like everyone else, i too enjoy traveling. i've
traveled in the middle east, western europe, a little in eastern
europe, scandinavia, central america, eastern canada, and a good
portion of the good ol' u.s. of a. next on my list is east
asia.<br />
<br />
i promise this is the only mention of rock climbing you'll find in
my entire profile. (not opposed, just haven't done it.)","after about 9 years in commercial real estate finance, i decided to

challenging, but also rewarding. it's hard to believe i'm almost
done; i can't wait to start this new phase in my life.<br />
<br />
i have a good sense of who i am and where i want to be, and i want
to be there with someone great. experience has made it much easier
to quantify the value of a work/life balance, and family and
friends are important to me. while i might not have fully
anticipated being where i am today, i have no major regrets and i
feel really good about the future.","making myself laugh; making others laugh; being a loyal and caring
friend; spouting random facts; spelling; gesturing unnecessarily
when excitedly discussing something; making mix cd's for friends;
buying too much wine <em>(well, there can never be too
much...)</em>; being sincere and listening when i need to; and like
the typical middle child, ever trying to break the tension and
mediate.","physically, probably my green eyes. more likely, people notice my
friendly, outgoing nature and sense of humor (which often includes
the off-color variety).","so many to list... <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=school"">school</a> doesn't give me much time to read
for pleasure these days, but here are a few of my favorite books to

(i know, i know... i like sedaris and murakami-very
original.)<br />
<br />
musically, i enjoy and listen to a fairly wide array of artists,
from rock to hip hop, but probably lean more to the indie rock side
of things, i.e., <a class=""ilink"" href=

well in short i love the grateful dead the outdoors camping music
festivals jam bands video games movies traveling and my friends.
lately however i have just been throwing myself into my work and my
video games kinda just staying home and hibernating for the winter.
i also really like to download entire series of tv shows and watch
them all at once its like a really long movie i love it","i own my own business and i travel a lot i don't really have much
direction past work i guess that's why i am on here is to try and
develop some kind of social life that is not related to my business
mixing the two tends to get me into trouble","managing things i am really good at finding peoples strengths and
pairing them with other peoples weakness's finding the right person
for the job that sort of thing it sounds silly but i really am good
at it. that and finding that little bit of good in a situation so i
can laugh about it","i am not really sure you should tell me what you noticed first so
that i have some input to put in this spot","favorite books are scifi and fantasy, i really like all the star
wars series novels anything written by anne mccaffery or robert
jordan the dune series and dragonlance all amazing. movies i have
really simelar tastes as my reading selection except i really like
comedies. music is jam bands: grateful dead, string cheese
incident, sts9, bassnecter, camo cowboys, blue turtle seduction, i
really enjoy dancing at really grimy dubstep parties . food i am a
vegetarian pretty strictly i eat sushi a few times a year as its
normally ends up being a good compromise for fancy business

raw for a bit but i am not quite ready for that yet.","1. ganja<br />

future or at least avenues i can follow to get to certain places.
kinda how frank herbert describes paul muad'dib seeing the golden
path in dune i know you are saying yeah right and i am not claiming
this is surefire or even close to being accurate but its something
i have learned to trust as when i see a path i know i need to
follow it calls me till i begin to walk down it and the longer i
wait the more stuff usually that goes wrong","there is no such thing as a typical friday for me or a typical any
day of the week for that matter the world is my oyster i come and
go most places with the wind and am never really sure of what i
will be doing more than a week in advance","i have been sitting here trying to figure out a good answer to this
question but in reality i am a pretty open book i have answered all

probably something i am not willing to admit too at least not right
here but if you ask me i will likely tell you anything so really
all you have to do is ask......<br />

action part in a movie or something","you are an adult into good conversations if you are bored or if you
just need somebody to talk too i mean if you are just messaging me

"i am a female gendered person living in san francisco. that narrows
it down quite a bit. i am not a hipster, rather i am the kind of

vintage dresses, this is however, not the case.<br />

careful and intuitive communicator. enfp all the way.<br />

i would like to make the disclaimer that my previous and arbitrary
list of facts make it difficult, nae impossible to tell much about
me. i am ok with that. if it helps, and perhaps it might, i will
let you know that i can make ethernet and audio cables, hack you
wireless, and do some other technical magic that most people don't
care to know or know how to do. i was the kid putting my toys
together myself, rather than my parents and then getting bored and
ripping them apart. later i was the teenager on the proto-internet

"i'm always up for an adventure, large or small, and i have a knack
for finding them. i'm an instigator, a troublemaker, a motivator
and one to persuade you that staying at home on this fine day is a
bad idea. i'm easily amused and rarely bored and generally up for
most things (at least once) as i've found that there's fun to be
had pretty much anywhere. outdoors, indoors, in far flung corners
of the world or in the neighbourhood park. i like adventures in
food, in music, in art and science, and in the random, the bizarre
and the ridiculous. i've travelled a lot and have many, many grand
plans, but i do love the experience that is living in san
francisco.<br />
<br />
i like variety. i'm as happy staying out all night dancing and
sleeping all day as getting up at the crack of dawn to head out on
a trip somewhere. other days it's nice to just chill out, sit
still, and do very little.<br />
<br />
contributing something worthwhile to the world is important to me.
this starts with my personal mission of increasing self-awareness
and trying to live my life as the conscious, honest, positive, and
caring person that i strive to be. helping my friends and other
people around me to be happier is a big driving force for me. and
after i solve that, somehow i'm going to save the world. just as
soon as i work out how....","i work as a field applications scientist  a job which no-one has
ever heard of but which i enjoy greatly because it's challenging
but affords a lot of freedom, autonomy and room to be creative. i
spend a lot of time teaching, problem-solving, meeting new people
and blinding them with science in order to sell our very cool,
expensive box. i also like that i get to alternate dressing up in
fancy suits (or moonsuits, depending on the job) with working at
home drinking tea in my pajamas.<br />
<br />
but while my work is fun, not working is clearly more fun, and
maintaining a good balance is very important to me. i've done the
60+ hour work-weeks before and i'm over it. in fact if i could work
out how to have 6 months off every year for travel, or 4 day
weekends all the time i'd be all over that.<br />
<br />
i'm very active and like to be outside as much as possible. i have
a penchant for dangerous sports but sadly have had to curb that
recently since my last hang gliding lesson didn't go so well rock
climbing was my first love but lately i've been kayaking a lot. i
bought two sea kayaks at the end of last year and have been hugeley
enjoying exploring with those. and very recently i've got to play
with the the whitewater, which is great fun . and there's scuba,
and finding hotsprings, hiking, and playing in the snow, and
feeling the sand between my toes on the beach, or lying in the sun
watching clouds .... or just appreciating what an incredibly
beautiful part of the world i live in.<br />
<br />
i'm also trying to improve my meditation practice - or at least
practice more often. i'd put myself in the ""spiritual but not
religious"" box but not the ""very new age"" one. it would be nice to
meet someone with a similar outlook, but some shared understanding
and acceptance of core values is really what matters.<br />
<br />
i'm happy with my life and appreciate what i have, but i'm trying
this internet dating business because ultimately i'm also looking
for a somewhat like-minded, fun, loving man to share a meaningful
relationship and start a family at some point in the next few
years. we don't have to agree on everything, nor like all the same
things, but if you're only looking for something casual, are very
conservative, not into the outdoors at all or don't want kids then
we're probably not compatible.","making new friends, telling stories, laughing, solving problems,

in with a good book / movie and relaxing from the work week.","i see a lot of people saying it's embarrassing being on okcupid. i
don't think it is, i believe it's the new age of dating - it's just
another avenue to meet people. bars &amp; clubs are fun, but it's
difficult to meet compatible, quality people.<br />

most private thing i'm willing to admit would probably be that i'm
such a light sleeper that i need to wear earplugs every night to
sleep well.","you're ambitious in life, athletic, open-minded, at least 5'8, and

board games with. i am not looking for ""casual encounters"" via this

can see that while we do enjoy the occasional euro game, we
definitely like ""americatrash"" stuff as well. :)<br />

while we do both play/dm rpgs, we are looking for a group to play
board games with.","in our normal lives we both hold professional 9-5ish type jobs. i

culture essays, graphic novels, science-fiction and<br />
steampunk.<br />
movies: my favorite directors are: jim sheridan, david cronenberg,
neil jordan, david lynch, mike judge, fritz lang, george lucas. i
love bad horror movies, documentaries, science-fiction, silly
comedies, and silent movies.<br />
music: my pandora station implies that i like melodic punk,
synth-pop, emotional male lead vocal performances, classic rock,
and a mixture of major and minor key tonality. with that said i'm a
big fan of bad religion, depeche mode, nitzer ebb, queen, billy
joel, etc, etc, etc. i have over 9,000 songs on my ipod.<br />

think) who enjoys good friends, beautiful scenery, a good laugh,
being playful and enjoying the crazy road of life. i have lived in
the bay for the past 13 years and still find new and amazing things
about it all the time. when i'm not working or spending time with

"i'm pretty easy going. i grew up in the central prairies of canada,
though i was a city boy, i had a fair amount of small-town life
growing up. so, i tend to appreciate the simpler things of life:
i'd rather ride my bike or hike for exercise than hop on a
treadmill. cars are useful now and then, but i love riding the
trains around town. texting has its uses, but i'd rather hear your
voice, or better yet see your eyes crinkle at my lame jokes in
person. i don't really care too much what i am doing, as long as i
am with good people. though, i have a curious mind, and like to
learn about new things and hear new perspectives. i tend to like
music/film/art that is stirring and has a lot of tension to it. on
the flip side, i like my actual life to be pretty drama-free. the
thing i appreciate most is a good conversation: some current events
mixed with pop culture references, sprinkled with some off-colour
humor and the odd moment of revelation... something like that.","enjoying it. i have a good career, but i also appreciate a good
life outside of work. like to get out into nature now and then, but
also take advantage of this ridiculous urban environment that is
the bay area.","remembering random trivia. being nerdy, but with a hint of
machoness. sarcasm.","glasses, eyes, ...uh... sometimes my accent comes out, especially
if beer is involved.","my doctor said that i have a mild case of the hipster. tastes
change often, but old favourites include: patrick watson, daily
show, most wes anderson films, kati rolls, radiohead, douglas
adams, pretty much any alterna-country
(calexico/sadies/iron&amp;wine), some coen bros, bonono, shawerma,
decemberists, breaking bad, the cinematic orchestra.","camera, laptop, good friends, some sort of music-producing machine,
decent hiking boots, and a sense of irony.","clouds. they are fluffy. actually, i like to solve problems. the
more abstract the better.","out with friends. perhaps dinner and a pub, perhaps at a soiree at
someone's house, perhaps an old film house (e.g., castro theater),
maybe catching a band somewhere.",hello....?,you find the little message button calling to you.
"a sense of humor always carries the day! i like to think i have a
positive approach to life, and my personality reflects that. i'm
articulate and sometimes witty, yet i still find joy in the simple
pleasures and appreciate life's basic offerings.<br />
<br />",i'm in grad school and working.,"enjoying the moment and interacting with others. i'm also very
athletic and a strong runner.",my height and my smile.,"house of sand and fog is one of my favorite books. a favorite movie
is office space. i am open to lots of music! and, i have a passion
for pasta!","my family, my friends, exercise, my own place, my car, my laptop,

watching a movie, surfing the net, and talking on the phone!",i have a weakness for sweets!!,"you appreciate a genuine fun guy who has the courage to be his own
person!"
"i like to make things and tinker with stuff, and do things just for
the sake of doing them, rather than to save money or use/eat the
finished product.<br />
<br />
i don't keep a budget, nor use an alarm clock, nor shave every day.
my bedroom is littered with tools, bits of wire, and half finished
projects. however, i do shower every day, will hold doors open for
you, and i always say please and thank you.<br />
<br />
lately i've been baking sourdough bread (i have replicated
tartine's country loaf very well), making pizza (inspired by sf's
own pizza hacker), woodworking at the tech shop (i built a jukebox
from scratch), and learning everything there is to know about my
motorcycle.<br />
<br />
i've been fortunate enough to do a bit of traveling lately, and
have been on the road quite a bit in the past 2 years. my last two
trips were 5 weeks in central america (highlight was learning to
scuba dive), and 3 weeks in china. i've also hopped around greece
and the balkans for 2 months, visited alaska to camp and fish, and
driven down to cabo san lucas and back for a bachelor party.","contracting as a software engineer and traveling.<br />
<br />
i stopped working full time about two years ago, i have a lot of
free time as a result. if you want to go to the park at 1pm on
tuesday, then i'm in.","being passionate about things. i try to perfect my hobbies and my
work, and don't half-ass things.","besides my irresistible charm and charisma?<br />
<br />
i'm tall and lanky. i am often opinionated and blunt.","i own books (and read them!).<br />
<br />
my favorite movie is true romance, but not for the reasons you
might expect. i really like wes anderson and p.t. anderson movies,
but at the end of the day i'll pretty much watch anything.<br />
<br />
i listen to a lot of late 90's and early 2000's punk music. no, i
did not go to the slapstick reunion show a few months ago.<br />
<br />
i am a connoisseur of carne asada burritos, margherita pizza, and
coffee. ask me what the best places are in sf!","two-wheeled transportation<br />

<br />
i used to occasionally sell chicken and waffle sandwiches to help
my friends' business out.",i like receiving flowers in addition to giving them.,"you're confident and a good communicator. you want to get a drink
somewhere."
"i'll blather on about myself so you get an idea of who i am but i
will keep it short-- i'd rather talk in person.<br />
<br />
i've got both sides of the brains. a little more left (analytical)
than right (in the moment). sometimes neither.<br />
<br />
i am playful at least my dog thinks so.<br />
<br />
overall, i'm a curious person. i've always wondered why... i love
to try to figure out new things and tinker. i am now an expert on
repairing weed wacker carburetors.<br />
<br />
i think doing is more fulfilling than getting. i am not a stuff
person. spending time with people and outdoors is something i find
the most fulfilling in life.","well, since the snow season was short lived and it was the 1st time
i bought a season pass in december... it wasn't skiing.<br />
<br />
living. so far, so good. believe me-- that was not a trite comment.
long story.<br />
<br />
i like to keep busy. i have an energetic dog so i go for a gopher
hunting expedition at least once a day. otherwise, i love to learn
so i'm always into something when i'm not working. i made paper
airplanes using a laser cutter last week (i'll try to keep that
updated).<br />
<br />
work is good. i don't mind it but sometimes it takes all day. i'm
considered a ""professional"" in a technical field so i need to put
on my game face from time to time. i also have been working on an
invention for ever-- patent pending.<br />
<br />
i play piano every night even if for 5 min.<br />
<br />
running long distances. the instructions are easy to remember and
is good for you.<br />
<br />
i love to windsurf way into the bay or on the ocean. i once saw a
mola mola and had a baby seal sit on my sail.<br />
<br />
i also fit in the occasional trip. my last big expedition was to
japan. i am fascinated by the place. i just like how the people
have pride in their society more than anywhere else i have been.
flyfishing is next in july at a friend's cabin and then july is a
bike riding trip in whistler,","tinkering. i am constantly taking things apart and trying to put
them to other uses. currently, i've been spending my time focusing
on these little black computer chips and making them make homemade
speakers pop and whistle. i someday hope to make a moving
synthesizer that people can interact with.<br />
<br />
i've been told i am a good listener-- i can't remember who said it
though or in what context:)<br />
<br />
i have a biting wit. however, i am not an angry person.<br />
<br />
i can cook. i bake tasty, hot bread and can mix a mean gibson and
grill up a hell of a steak. yup, i'm not the guy for a vegan but i
do eat tons of veggies.",not sure why but i get asked for directions all the time,"i like books and movies and cerebral junk like that. i just saw a
norwegian movie ""headhunters"". i thought it was brilliant-- a bit
gruesome but an interesting wit. i am currently reading the
""elegance of the hedgehog"" and just finished ""portnoy's
complaint""-- book club choices. my favorite book is a ""confederacy
of dunces"".<br />
<br />
i have a wide range of musical taste. i know if i like it when i
hear it. i especially like beethoven's concertos, progressive rock
from the early 70's (emerson, lake and palmer!), and stream various
electronica (although i can't identify a single band).<br />
<br />
i do not have a tv.","absurd humor, a piano, the outdoors, my dog, punctuation, human
connection, a little silence, www.epicmealtime.com","candy and what makes something funny. what the hell my dog is
thinking. and why ok cupid recommends people to me that haven't
logged on since before the last super bowl.","i'm usually at home on a friday night being mellow reading,
practicing piano or catching up with a few friends over a drink.",can you keep a secret?:),"are a bit devilish, a good listener and a good talker, likes dogs
and cares about stuff in general and if you think you look good in

"hello there :)<br />
<br />
in a fragment: i am an intellect. with an enormous heart. i'm down
to earth. i'm genuine....and genuinely happy.<br />
<br />
i currently research the cellular mechanisms and biological
pathways that cause aging and age related diseases. i'm doing this
as i apply for a doctorate in nursing. in acute care/trauma. cause

let's make this a bit more interactive. you're attractive,
brilliant, and successful. you are just my type..but you pass on
by. why?","in short, expanding horizons, establishing a strong foundation and
loving every moment of my blessed life.","i strive to be really good at whatever i put my mind and hands to.
i was raised by a hardcore polish mom, so my sister and i are
expected to know everything, do everything, excel at everything and
not break a sweat doing it (if only that were possible). obviously,
those are unrealistic expectations, but worthy goals, nonetheless.","i live with purpose and passion. i am, by no means, a wall flower.
i rarely do things on whim..i do them with heart and soul and
feeling.","books are delicious.<br />
music is pretty grand as well.<br />
and food: i'll sum it up with: i live to eat. food is an art, a
medium to transfer my love and care to the people in my life.","love the people who treat you right. forget about the ones who
don't. believe that everything happens for a reason. if you get a
chance, take it. if it changes your life, let it. nobody said it
would be easy, they just promised it would be worth it.","what i can do to keep ahead, get more edge, be a better
person.<br />
<br />
how to make prioritizing my priorities a priority. now that i put
it that way, you're thinking priority is a weird word. but isn't
weird, weird too? ha.","either out and about and having the time of my life, or laying low
and relaxing. it all depends on what kind of week i've had. i do
enjoy both extremes.","i lean towards guys that aren't ""hot"". i've found that muscle size
is directly proportional to ego size. if you've got a good body and
you have more to discuss than just how much you work out and how
hot you think you are, you'd be an amazingly pleasant surprise.","you're mentally on my plane. you know what you're looking for
in<br />
life and in your significant other.<br />
<br />
if we're getting down to the nitty gritty, i'd love to have
moments<br />
where i stand back in awe and just admire you. feel lucky to
the<br />
core that i can call you mine. if you're capable of doing that,
by<br />
all means, send me a message.. i'm already smitten ;)<br />
<br />
not intentionally ending on a down note, but if you resonate
with<br />
the cliche phrase ""i'm just your average joe"" i'm not sure
we'll<br />
get along that well. life's too short for mediocracy."
"how are you supposed to start these things?<br />
hi, my name is josiah. i like working, playing, conversing, making
art, riding on a bike instead of in a car (wind on face can't be
beat), watching squirrels or birds play, daydreaming about
inventions ...<br />
<br />
i like to wander around and chat. urban environments are ok, but my
top themes are waterfronts, a ceiling of trees, vistas, and unkempt
areas along streams or train tracks. if a forest is within walking
distance, i'll drift towards it.<br />
<br />
i tend to be kind and gentle. i'm generous and most people consider
me a good friend. i keep a cool head under stress and have immense
amounts of patience. i dislike needless conflict; i make my points
peacefully and am good at de-escalating situations. that said, i
prefer being direct in my communications.<br />

coast.<br />
<br />
i am really excited that summer is around the corner, i love
hanging in the park, people watching in outdoor cafes, eating
watermelons and strawberries.<br />
<br />
i also love to travel, my favorite places so far have been the
amazon in brazil, machu picchu and athens. the only continents i
haven't set foot on are africa and antarctica. hopefully i can
change that soon, well maybe not antarctica...<br />
<br />
i love sports and pretty much can hold my own when playing or
watching. usually i am a yankee fan, but it really depends on who
is winning (what can i say? i am a poser). we'll have to see if i
become a giants fan.<br />
<br />
what i am looking for: i am looking for someone who is quirky,
silly but also smart and ambitious. i love to be funny so if you
can make me laugh you are in. someone who shares my love to travel
and who likes explore the city. i am looking for someone who
doesn't shy away from the dance floor. and most importantly someone
who i can be myself with.","right now? well, i am trying to enjoy every minute of it.<br />

the seasons of southeastern michigan. a recent sf transplant, i've
fallen fast for this city.<br />

i'm laid back and generally low-maintenance. if $250 dollars fell
into my lap right now, i'd be more likely to do something
experiential with it like take a private cooking class or go to a
tasting than buy a purse or a pair of shoes.<br />
<br />
i'm forward and sarcastic and you have to be able to handle me and
dish it back :d. i can be extremely goofy one minute and totally
focused the next, but i definitely can't sit still. i'm extremely
loyal and i don't believe in revenge or holding grudges (blame the
psychology and communications majors).","advertising sales! i like it and it suites me.<br />

possible about food and the food industry, and planning my next
trip (just returned from thailand, considering my next
destination).","listening, meeting people on planes, eating food (less good at the
actual cooking part), making people laugh, getting people together,

crazy lives and experiences. anything by anthony bourdain, augusten

also really enjoyed reading the game, and can now call guys out for

chocolate factory, gattaca, paris, je t'aime, crazy, stupid, love,

music: i'm admittedly bad at seeking out new music. here's what my
most recent workout playlist sounds like: mgmt, robyn, matt &amp;
kim, t.i., lady gaga, passion pit, kid cudi and la bouche

grad school in upstate new york, spent a couple of winters in salt

american values, and a san franciscan's insatiable burrito

skills and a sense of humor to join me for urban expeditions,
oysters and beer in point reyes, games of bananagrams, traipsing

road trips to states we've never been to, talking about things we
read in the newspaper, kitchen misadventures, and [optional] the
occasional saturday night with garrison keillor.","i work in the communications department of an arts nonprofit.

my professional life matters to me, but i'm also generally the type
who leaves work at work. outside of my weekday 9-to-5, i spend my
time building and maintaining a pretty healthy social network (the
real-life kind), cooking, hiking, going to movies, reading the new
york times wedding section, and working my way down a very long

rather endearing, but your parents might not.<br />
<br />
i often (aka always) have cat hairs on me. if you have inferred
that this means i probably associate with felines, then i
appreciate your comprehensive reading skills and believe this could
be the beginning of a magical relationship.<br />
<br />
my driving is either atrocious or perfectly natural, depending on
if the observer has ever driven in a city (especially sf)
before.<br />
<br />
once, during a discussion about crime increase in the neighborhood
(especially after the 8hr hostage situation that happened next
door) my oldest friend offered some advice to the neighbors about
my superior protection abilities:<br />
""trust me, if someone tried to steal her purse, she'd chase them
down and kick the crap out of them while yelling 'if you think this
hurts, my parents are lawyers and we're going to sue your ass so
hard you're going to really need this money!'""<br />
lesson: in the game ""robbers, paper, scissor"" a drunken burglar
would beat a tipsy thief every time.<br />
... or maybe i'm just one tough cookie. with free legal counsel.","<strong>movies:</strong><br />
i like them.<br />
<br />
<strong>tv shows:</strong><br />
twin peaks, parks and recreation, arrested development, 30 rock,
its always sunny in philadelphia, peep show, ted talks<br />
<br />
<strong>music:</strong><br />
passion pit, the national, girltalk, yeah yeah yeahs, rilo kiley,
band of horses, the kooks, yelle, animal collective, spoon, mgmt,
&lt;3 miike snow &lt;3<br />
really getting into dubstep and electronica.<br />
<br />
<strong>food:</strong><br />
i suck at feeding myself.<br />
<br />
<strong>books:</strong><br />
too many to list. right now, i'm knee deep in some textbooks -
finance and strategy management? where does the fun stop??!<br />
<br />
<strong>favorite things not in aforementioned
categories:</strong><br />
- resisting being told what to do (as displayed by my defiance of
okc's summary categories)<br />
- people with pun-loving attitudes.<br />
- beards are almost always a smart choice.<br />
- apple products (thankfully, the slow deterioration of
self-respect at the hands of steve jobs and his cult is mostly
obscured by each shiny new toy they create.)<br />
- feeling superior, but only because i'm so much better at it than
anyone else.<br />
- craigslist missed connections<br />
- puzzles<br />
- competition<br />
- bill belichick<br />
- coca-cola classic<br />
- legal pads","leniency.<br />
earplugs.<br />
pillows.<br />
captive audiences.<br />
chapstick. no, seriously - i'm always within 25 ft of some
chapstick.","the okc robot. i mean, what's his deal? why does he work so hard to
pair us up? is this the robot way of warning us that there's a
potential noah's ark situation coming up?<br />
<br />
luck.<br />
more importantly - analogies.<br />
<br />
just how much of my naked dancing the lucky people in the offices
across the street can see.<br />
... and is there some way i can profit off of this?","for legal purposes, i can't divulge too much about a
drunkenburglar's average friday night. but until those restraining
orders calm down, i enjoy pretty low key nights - friday night
happy hours, movies, events around the city. somehow, inevitably,
burritos always seem to be involved.<br />
<br />
every once in a while though, i do walk the dangerous side. this
tends to involve:<br />
<strong>1</strong> attempt at some totally unnecessary
technological thing that is so far out of my league it's been
tested for steroids<br />
<strong>1</strong> headache after refusing help from anyone but the
nebulous internet and my own mind grapes<br />
<strong>-2</strong> saved from a possible murder/suicide situation
when the combined lack of sleep between my mac and i force quits
the entire operation for the both of us<br />
<em><strong>(1+1)-2=</strong></em><br />
<strong>0</strong> actually accomplished.","i don't like the sf giants. sorry can't unsay it now.<br />
<br />
i can't poop in public bathrooms. however, i can talk about it to
no end.<br />
<br />
after recently moving out of my studio and acquiring roommates with
more personality than my cats, i keep forgetting that it's
inappropriate to enter most rooms while still dressing. same goes
for bathroom stalls.<br />
<br />
i rarely ever listen to ""rap/hip hop"", but every time i hear ""carry
out"" it makes me randy.","- <em>you think i'm the bee's knees</em> (although obviously that
won't slim down the pool at all)<br />
- <em>you understand that there is a very good chance i will rename
you.</em> no, not like snuggy bear or hug captain (although those
are definitely now going into my hat for later) but i don't care if
you parents named you willard after your great grandpa - if you
look like a henry, mauricio, cody, etc. i will be unable to call
you anything else. it's endearing, don't worry.<br />
- <em>you don't have a weird mouth.</em> now, this means nothing to
me and i couldn't definite an oral oddity if i tried. my mother,
however, has very strong, extremely vocal opinions about them; i,
in turn, have very strong opinions about having to listen to her
more than normal. it's a lose/lose situation for you."

and i have a huge amount of <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=patience"">patience</a>.<br />
<br />
i have a monstrous capacity to <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=love"">love</a> and nearly equal appetite for sex.

and then they can <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=honest"">honest</a>ly see what their dreams are.
people tend to chase after the dreams that give them the illusion
of being loved. if one does not live honestly, one does not live
the life they are meant to live. just the one they think they
want.<br />
<br />
the reason i am here is to find a lover. someone who has no hang
ups about the <a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=poly"">poly</a>
thing. it is my hope that i might come across some friends along
the way as well. so, feel free to message me for friendship too.
i've noticed that a lot of people here tend to believe ""everyone is
here for love and/or sex"". well, i beg to differ. granted i did not
primarily come here for friendship. however, if i were just looking
for just friends this would not be a bad place to start. right now,
i presently have no poly friends and it's not terribly easy to find
poly folk walking down the street. it would be nice to gain a few
like minded friends.<br />

i am exuberant, yet mello, and unfiltered","i'm always looking for the missing puzzle pieces of life. if i
can't find them i try to make them.<br />

i am a freelance camera operator. i hope to someday make my own
film that will improve peoples lives.","above all... listening. (more people should try and practice that
one). aside from that, i like to think of myself as a good camera
operator. i haven't worked as a carpenter for some time (wanted to
chase a dream instead), but i'm a good carpenter. i've been told
i'd make a good mediator. i'm an okay cook (yet unpredictable). i'm
good at empathizing with people which helps me to be good at caring
about people. and if you'll forgive me for a little not so dry
humor, i have a well trained tongue that loves to come out and

"not great at self-summary. so, see below.","well. doing new stuff. like trying this internet thing my favorite
new skill i have mastered is riding my friend suzy's tall bicycle.
i spent a long time on it first time as i wasn't brave enough to
try and get off. my favorite new skill i haven't mastered is aerial
dance. at the first lesson, we had to share why we there and what
our skills were, my answer of i'm a rock climber and i like
dancing in the desert' was rather at odds with the 4 years of
modern dance' and 3 years of circus skills' of everyone else..
turns out that isn't such a good background for aerial as i
thought. still it's fun, i just can't say i've mastered it yet. i
am also wondering whether trying to save the planet through a large
corporation is really working. might be time to downsize.","what a troubling question for someone who is self effacing. . i'm

i don't have any tattoos. if i did though, i wouldn't puss out, i
would get a real piece of art worth showing.<br />
<br />
i can be quite sarcastic. often times i am very shy, but my friends
tell me in social settings they don't notice it. i think that is
because if i am feeling too shy i head for zee hills rather than
hang out and feel awkward. i have been known to ask the waitress
stupid questions when i am at a restaurant. i should write a book
with a variety of waitress opinions on various subjects.","whatever the fuck i want.<br />

travel so much that i really get to appreciate the place city when
i am in town! i like balance in life with work,play, party, family,
party. never taking things too seriously and starting each day off
with something goofy.. smile first and worry latter!<br />
<br />
spontaneous is something i like to take advantage. in my free time
there are three passions (say this lightly) is food, music, sports
(playing them more than watchin them), and travelin (nothing better
than lil road trip or quick fly out). rather be out in the sun when
its out in sf then cooped all day in the house!<br />

i am extremely sarcastic who is never shy to spark a convo and like

important...."
"to begin, i'd like to pose a question... wouldn't it be wonderful
if men and women could come to the realization that we're truly
different and that we don't have to have everything in common in
order to make a relationship work? what happened to the concept or
idea that what you ""bring to the table"" can be unique and different
than your partner... and that's what makes the feast so much more
exciting and delicious!<br />

plain and simple, i'm a <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=guitarist"">guitarist</a>... in the mornings, i sell
guitars at an amazing local music shop, here on the peninsula... in
the afternoons, i have a thriving teaching business instructing the
youth of america how to rock! *wink*... and then on the occasional
weekend, i back it up by playing live music in a local cover-band
as well, where *i* do the rocking... lol! no, i'm not the
wealthiest man on the planet, but i wouldn't trade what i'm doing
for any other kind of work... i'm my own boss, i make my own hours,
and i have a very enriching, if not fulfilling, experience passing
on what i know to others about playing <a class=""ilink"" href=

of it all with others... especially kids!!! (that's because i
haven't forgotten what it's like to be one!) :o)<br />

i've been described by some of my friends and family as one of the
nicest people they know (man, have i got them fooled... *insert
sinister laugh*... lol!) my sister has referred to me as being
""terminally polite""... don't get me wrong, i definitely have a dark
side... i think that we all do, right? meaning, anybody who
declares that they don't have ""baggage"" is basically in denial,
right?! like it or not, we're all carrying something along from our
past relationships... romantic, platonic, familiar (meaning,
pertaining to family), you name it... it's made us who we are,
no?!<br />
<br />
who am i looking for? i'll know when i see her smile... pardon the
clich, but she might be ""the girl next door""... i know, i know...
*yawn*, right?! lol! but it's the truth... someone who finds
pleasure and satisfaction from the simple things in life... good
food, good drink, enjoying friends, going to <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=san+francisco%0agiants"">san francisco giants</a>
games, taking in a movie... hopefully likes seeing her man play
some live music every one in a while... maybe likes to dance?! ;o)
i'll know when i see her smile... nothing wrong with her being
stylish or enjoying the finer things in life, it's just that i
would prefer to be with someone who isn't so necessarily high
strung or high maintenance... don't get me wrong, i may not be
""metro-sexual"" or super-stylish, but i certainly ""clean up"" well
and enjoy dressing up and having a good time!<br />

once upon a time there was a sexy brazilian woman and a geeky
american man who fell in love. they had 3 beautiful daughters, the
middle child being the most amazing. they split time between brazil
and the us but chose to raise the lovely girls in the us where they
went on to be very smart and talented. the middle child was an avid
soccer player growing up and loved to draw and travel. she went on
to college to play soccer and study architecture and then decided
her education was best suited for the up and coming field of
renewable energy. plus fighting over oil always pissed her off. the
lovely middle daughter grew into an amazing young lady and enjoys
her work in renewable energy. she thought it would be cool to be a
ninja and really liked their outfits. so she took up martial arts
in the passing five years, an activity she hopes to master. the
lovely lady became an avid lover of adventure who carries a special
place in her heart for extraordinary pursuits, unbounded courage,
unparalleled hard work, and perseverance of spirit. however, she
has always been waiting for her prince charming, so

paragraph, 3rd sentence down, and it defines your life?

""i've discovered how to turn most any love song into a sea
shanty!""<br />
<br />
and i've done so, too.<br />
<br />
<b>you</b><br />
you're passionate about what you do for a living and with your
life. you're curious, analytical, like to teach (and learn). you
thrive both on and off the grid. you're geeky, somewhat nerdy (and
know they're different). you live to your own beat, value time
spent alone, yet long to share your life and experiences with
someone special. you're caring, casual, easy-going, happy, stable.
gentle, but strong and willful. a determined problem-solver, you
strive to be self-sufficient. you're somewhat clean and take great
care of yourself. you're environmentally-minded. you love dogs.
you're nocturnal. you don't feel the need to wear makeup all the
time (at all, even). you dress casually or awesomely (e.g. converse
or steel-toed boots); you don't dress yourself up like a present
(unless, and only if, it's bay to breakers, you're being ironic,
and you're not hoping to turn me on).<br />
<br />
your age... doesn't matter (within reason). you're attractive, fit,
and local. you're into at least one acceptably dangerous activity
and enjoy calculated risks. you favor trying new things and are
equally happy not doing so. e.g. if you're not already into it, i
wouldn't have to drag you, kicking and screaming, to go rock
climbing with me (i will), nor would you crawl out of your skin if
we decided to stay in and cook, watch a movie, or play some games
(we will).<br />
<br />
you'll get me excited about <i>your</i> interests and drag me
along, kicking and screaming!<br />
<br />
<b>me</b><br />
everything above, gender-corrected.<br />
<br />
healthy, fit, smart, geeky, a relaxed atheist. detail-optimized
with a technical approach to most things -- even creativity (it's
not as paradoxical as it sounds). i solve hard problems at work
with whiteboards, and at home with transparent duct tape (and no
shame); but just as happily take it easy or act like a doof when it
doesn't matter.<br />
<br />
my work gives me a lot of flexibility (financially, time-wise,
mentally, physically) to do other things with my life. my
dog/familiar is (objectively, with references) one of the most
glamorous (see ted talk on glamor), smartest, and happiest dogs you
might ever get to meet.<br />
<br />
i'm into all humor and sarcasm, no matter how dark or [potentially]
offensive (and take offense to <i>nothing</i>: try me). i don't get
worked up if you make a less-than-socially-acceptable joke -- if
it's funny, i'll find the humor in it and throw one back.
observations, well-founded or ironic, are not necessarily beliefs
(and if they are -- do you act on them?).<br />

years ago and i love it. being by the water makes me feel like i'm
on vacation all the time!<br />

i am active. i hike 2 - 3 times a week (training for a backpacking
trip). i have a sit-on-top kayak that i take out more often in the
summer; i like going on bike rides (completed 2 centuries, but not
as much into that anymore); i am a padi certified scuba diver, but
have only gone out once (in fiji - it was amazing).<br />
<br />
i love the outdoors and i'm outside as much as possible when the
sun is. i love taking pictures and almost always have my camera.i
also like exploring some of the local festivals and farmers'
markets or going over to the coast for the day and hanging out and
having lunch. i also like dressing up and going out. a day of wine
tasting is always fun too and i like exploring some of the lesser
known wine areas that are becoming popular.<br />

yself and pushing myself a bit out of my comfort zone (like going
backpacking for the first time ever -4 days in yosemite in august
2012; can't wait!) i am a very honest person and i expect the same
from my partner. i am loyal, loving and caring. i usually find
myself focusing only on the good in people, which unfortunately has
lead me to make some poor choices in relationships, but i'd still
rather see the good. i am a positive person and i like to have only
positive people in my life. my household is calm and it's important
for me to maintain that sense of calm. no yelling, please. i am in
a good place and am very happy with my life and the woman i have
become.<br />

to do and who will teach/show me new things. i like people who are
open minded, who will accept people for who they are and who are

intelligent, hard working, confident, funny, happy, and who likes
to cuddle. i do think it's important for both people to have their
individual ""me"" time (or time with their same sex friends). i
dislike drama (except for the theater), so no drama please!","right now half my life is spent raising two teenage girls whom i

not like about me first -<br />
i'm goofy, energetic, get excited easily, and always everywhere at
once.<br />
i'm short in stature, not always the best with logic, and take very
little seriously when it comes to everything except my
career.<br />
i'm spontaneous, have adhd, and can be the most organized
unorganized person ever.<br />
i tend to over plan some things then forget to plan the
essentials.<br />
my personality is crazy eclectic, and i flip from having the
maturity of a teenager to that of an old man. i love animals more
then people most days, and will stick up for a dog over a human.
(sorry human!)<br />
i tend to talk to everyone at once and play host no matter where i
am.<br />
i am outrageous, a performer at all times, and could care less if i
have an audience or not. i can be annoying....this is something i
know about myself<br />
but, if you can get past my faults -<br />
i'm witty, loving, and try to be exceptional partner in all
aspects.<br />
i'm fun, generous, and can make almost anyone laugh.<br />
i love to do things for people to let them know i care, wont let
anyone be left in the corner, and always stick up for the
underdog.<br />
i'm an adventurist, love to try new things, and i'm always
outgoing. most importantly ill always be loyal to those who i love,
and will sacrifice all that i can to prove it to them.<br />

"i'm a very easy going, drama free person, and, ideally, i'd like to
find someone like minded. i think i'd be happiest with someone who
has sown all the wild oats they're going to sow and has decided
that they are ready for a more grounded lifestyle. not someone who
is lazy or wants to stay home all of the time, but someone who can
be as happy at home as when we're out enjoying life. a sense of
humor and a love of my cats are absolute necessities. i don't
really have any ""hobbies"", but i watch entirely too much tv! i
enjoy listening to music--i really enjoy the 60's and 70's, motown,
oldies, etc. i also enjoy an occasional outing to places like pt.
reyes or bodega bay and a long drive up or down the coast is always
a good idea, right? i love visiting san francisco (like a tourist),
santa cruz (the beach boardwalk) and monterey (the aquarium). i
enjoy going to the movies, but don't do that very often. i'd like
to become more physically active in the outdoors--there is so much
to do and see and enjoy here--and it would be so much easier if i
could find someone who was interested in doing the same. i'm a
midwestern transplant (grew up in a very small kansas town)and,
although i've grown quite a bit, expanded my horizons and have
enjoyed so many life changing experiences during my time here, i've
managed to maintain my ""down home"" morals and values. i've been in
ca for 22 years now, and can't imagine living anywhere else on
earth. there is so much to do here and i'd really like to get out
there and experience it all! i'd love to meet a wonderful guy who's
easy going, low maintenance and ready to commit to a monogamous
relationship. ideally, i'd like to find a guy that loves to be
spoiled with attention, love and affection because that's what i
like myself. i'd never ask for more than i'm willing to give
myself. in addition to a life partner with whom i'd share my world,
i'm looking for a best friend. i don't know if that guy is really
out there, but i won't give up hoping to one day find him, capture
his heart and make him my very own! i love being a couple and i
must also admit that i love all the romance that should go along
with a loving relationship. it's been a very long time since i've
been in that kind of dream relationship, and i'd be so very happy
to find that again with someone special.<br />
although i've spent perhaps more time in bars that i should have,
that part of my life is over and i'm looking to become more
settled. i've never lived the wild gay life i've heard so much
about, but i don't think i've missed out on too much. i'm the kind
of person who one would identify as ""genuine"". i value
trustworthiness, loyalty and fidelity. i'm pretty particular about
the people i let into my life and i look for the same qualities i
think are my best.","hmmm. good question. i've been asking myself that for a couple of
years now! i need to make some changes and i'm looking for someone
to awe and inspire me. just kidding........well, sort
of............","being me. my friends tell me i'm the best kind of friend, so maybe
i'm good at that, too?","i can't say--i don't think there is anything out of the ordinary
with me. i will say, though, that i'm often approached in grocery
stores when the elderly need assistance so i guess i'm
approachable.","i know it's cliche, but i really do enjoy all kinds of music
(except rap) and, in particular, music from the 60's and 70's.
currently, my exercise time just wouldn't be the same without lady
gaga music, but perhaps that will pass. i used to do a lot of
country karaoke (is that weird?). i like movies but can't think of
any favorites just now. i appreciate movies mostly for the
entertainment value, and don't usually spend a whole lot of time
trying to find the true or hidden ""meaning"" some of my friends seem
so desperate to find. i guess i'm more fond of tv --i love watching
the discovery channel, the history channel and ghost hunters! i
like all kinds of food for the most part, i'm not a big seafood
fan. mexican, italian, thai--i love them all.","i don't know if there is anything i could never do without, short
of air, water, shelter and food, but i'd sure be lost without my
cats. i might not have a lot of anything, but i have everything
that i need, live comfortably and i know that i'm blessed.","why so many men view my profile but never say hi! what's up with
that? actually, i'm only thinking about that now---i'll probably
forget about it in a minute or two.......",usually relaxing and unwinding after a long week at work.,i've been watching all my children for 40+ years.,"you are looking to make a new friend, and maybe a new best friend.
romance and more is always a possiblity, and i'm certainly open to
that, but i like to get to know people as friends first. maybe you
just want to chat? we could discuss strategy in landing the next
great guy. i'm also looking for an activity partner who is local.
i'd love to have someone to accompany me to movies, festivals,
plays, etc. my best friend moved to texas a few years back, and i
still haven't found anyone i want to step in to that role."
"oh what to say about me. i'm a wonderful fun person. i like to say
i'm an extrovert with a maladaptive skillset. i am a programmer,
and coincidentally a bit of a nerd. i love exploring new things
especially with a good friend. i also recently discovered that i
love downhill skiing.<br />

sega genesis, i know its weird but they're probably just me holding
on to a bit of childhood.<br />
<br />
look i'm weird and a bit out there, i heart science, and rational
discussion. i like ball pits and climbing trees. bash is a shell.
and qed stands for quantum electro dynamics. i think geohashing is
neat, and occasionally i go to random websites and try the konami

out of bed. no i don't have a pocket protector. oh i love

<br />
edit: man i sound like such a nerd, which is i suppose true,
however i'm a pretty rounded person too. i also cook, bike, and
enjoy the occasional backpacking trip. along with other things. i'm
not glued to a computer 24/7 and most of the time i spend with one
is to make things.","i'm writing softwares and hanging out, and perfecting my craft.
really i'm starting to get into a routine, not a comforting thought

i did just move to oakland. the neighborhood i'm in is a bit...
colorful, but my roomates are pretty sweet and the space is huge!
its a converted warehouse which is sort of a boyhood dream of mine.
also my mattress just arrived today two weeks on an air mattress
really makes you appreciate a real bed.","math, games, empathy, winning! really i enjoy being good at things
there's a certain joy that i get from mastering a new skill and a
lasting sense of satisfaction in it. whenever i come to something
new i have this tendency to obsess over it until i've reached some
level of mastery.","my crazy whiteboy nerdfro (well not anymore it's short now). or the

<br />
immortality<br />
<br />
how people work<br />
<br />
how to get into more trouble without the traditionally commensurate
temporally protracted deleterious consequences.<br />
<br />
weather or not i should avoid my tendencies for applying a brutal
rationality to avoid or terminate uncomfortable social situations.","well i used to think of myself as an introvert but i can't remember
the last friday night i spent in. there's always something to do,
and i really do enjoy spending time out with my friends.",just about anything you're gutsy enough to ask about.,"you like talking about silly things.<br />
you enjoy long drives to nowhere.<br />
you enjoy chess.<br />
you want someone to respond in a rational and intelligent
fashion.<br />

you would like to go on a search for as many good climbing trees as

photo evidence.<br />
you have gone to a major chain bookstore and leave notes to future
readers in copies of your favorite books."

music: i think i have eclectic taste in music. i might be listening
to balinese gamelan music, followed by dj spooky. i might be
listening to hank williams and switch to karlheinz stockhousen or
dmitri shostakovich. i could be listening to mike patton screaming
with fantmas, followed by some gypsy music by fanfare ciocarlia or

i just moved to berkeley this year after living in san francisco

crossing the bridge isn't as bad as people think! you can often

actually, if you care to read beyond ""the list"" (feel free to
scroll past), i can offer a paragraph or two of prose. smiling and
laughter is a big hunk of what you get with me; if i'm not keeping
you amused, i'm not doing my job. those close to me always tell me
i have a gift for it. i'll also add that i'm a people person,
although the mere words make me wince a bit because that is one of
the most over-used terms in the history of humankind. ;-) let's
just say the times i tend to treasure the most include some number
of my friends, family, etc. i can also say that i'm a pretty clear
enfp, for those of you who follow the myers-briggs world out there.
while i certainly survive just fine on my own, i thrive among
others, particularly in small (intimate) groups.<br />
<br />
at the risk of sounding painfully generic one more time, i'll also
tell you that i like to live my life passionately. what are my
passions? great food and wine  i've explored my interests here all
over this country, and taken it to distant lands to boot. amazing
international wanders that crossed thru multiple countriesjapan,
thailand, vietnam, guatemala and borneo were fun, but italy and
france remain long-time favorites; spain isn't chopped liver
either. ;-) in parallel, i like to be able to speak in [some of]
those nation's languagesthus my pursuit of french, italian, and
spanish. i've also studied a few other languages at times, like
russian, hebrew, and greekbut that's more in my past now.","figuring out what i <em>most</em> want to do with my life<br />

<br />
so in the last couple of weeks i have thought about changing this
part of my profile. in my ideal world, people see the photos, then
they read the profile, then maybe they look at the photos again and
decide whether or not to message someone. in my ideal world, my
profile stays positive, doesn't list things for people not to do
when messaging me, and we all live happily ever after. apparently,
we are not living in my ideal world. damn. oh well. here we are.
i'm going to make this easier for all of us. in the first
paragraph, i said i was married. yes. i'm married! so if you are
going to message me and ask if i'm married, you can just read it
here first. how much easier for you and for me. wow, that really
clears things up. now, you want to know why, why, would anyone
married be on this site. i encourage you to actually read the
profile. yes! give it a try. you might like reading. if you don't
like reading, we probably won't get along anyway, and again, so
much easier for us to know that sooner rather than later.<br />
<br />
we are looking for friends - yes, friends. we already have friends.
i already have a husband (no, i'm not looking to cheat on him with
young guys), i know how to have fun, be silly, be serious, be
smart, be smart-ass, dance with or without a lampshade on my head.
but guess what everyone? you can have more! more is good! or as a
wonderful friend of mine says, more is more. want to message me?

love that, too. recently had my first experience at burning man. i
can't really describe it in words - at least words that would make

these two potentially conflicting descriptors, i've come to the
conclusion that you should just probably not be an asshole around
me. save it for someone who will put up with it. i'll take all you
kind, intelligent, wonderful people out there - and hey, if you're
just having a bad day, that's different - i'll take you then, too.

where they are operating on people (yes, it's true).<br />

<br />
books - well, i could go on and on here. currently reading
bossypants by tina fey - brilliant. david sedaris, augusten
burroughs, martha beck's expecting adam. i avoided reading eat,
pray, love because everyone else was reading it...then i finally
read it and liked it (the book, not the movie). i have a tendency
to do that...if everyone else is doing something, i don't want to
""do it too""...in fact it puts me off. oh, this is about books,
right...um, there's a lot.<br />

this doesn't ask about periodicals, but i am a magazine/newspaper

i also love wired, the week, the new yorker, the atlantic monthly,

fan. italian, indian, mexican (the good stuff), thai, a good steak

the type.<br />

movies: star wars (the originals), super troopers, saving grace,
pride and prejudice, firefly/serenity... and the list goes on. i
enjoy a good action flick, scifi is usually entertaining, not a
huge fan of the tear-jerkers, but occasionally i like the comedies.
not a huge fan of stupid humor (super troopers being a rare
exception) and i don't do horror. i scream like a little girl,
which is fine and generally funny for those around me, but i don't
like the nightmares my overactive imagination gives me.<br />

regularly than anything else, but my music selections are based on
mood. not generally a country fan and i'm not crazy about
rap.<br />

libraries, literally. it was a huge problem in elementary school
with their tiny libraries. according to my mother, i started at the
as worked my way all the way to the zs very quickly. we started
going to the public library after that. i love books, lately it's
been mostly about escapism (lots of school reading and reading for
work) but i'd like to get back into some more intellectual material
soon. we'll see.","my family, my dog (sam), my books, my kitchen, my down comforter,

saturdays, however, are for finding trouble. this generally works
best with company. i'm up for just about anything from dinner out
with friends to finding a bar and shooting pool. not much of a
clubber, but i can be convinced to dance if bribed with enough
beer.","nothing here, but if we ever meet in person, you can ask and i'll

chance the answer to this depends on the time of year in which the

building decides the heat needs to be jacked up to 78 degrees,
which might as well be a sauna when i'm dressed for winter.<br />

"currently a small business owner and healthcare practitioner,
starting an actual career after years of schooling and living off
of student loans. enjoying the satisfaction of getting paid to help
people feel better, because it's a life that had to be cultivated
over so many years behind books and desks.<br />
<br />
as a result of years behind books and desks, fatness ensued,
because there's a definite love for sweets and dessert. but since
there's no school, nor school-stress, there's no problem running
12-15 miles a week and doing qi gong in front of a lake. and core
exercises.. looots of core exercises. have dropped 35 pounds (!)
since graduation in december, and plan to keep losing it at a slow
and healthy pace. still loving desserts though!<br />

happily vegetarian, and not looking to convert nor judge, so it
doesn't matter if you happen to be or not. it does make sharing
food and kissing much easier though!<br />

tl;dr? than you should simply move on. it isn't often when
verbosity comes, but if it does, it's good when you can listen.","building the business aspects of massage therapy and acupuncture at

the more fun. it's rare when it doesn't turn out spectacular,

-being optimistic. looking at things differently than others. this
is as a result of growing up in a place that was recently(ish)

manufacturing companies leaving left and right and the hometown
economy stuttering to a halt years ahead of the rest of the
country. think if it started in 2001 instead of 2008.<br />
<br />
-empathizing. reading people and situations. people tend to find a
comfortable ear to rest on, and when coming for advice, both
medical (the patients i see at work), and personal (current friends
and lovers), they know that it comes from a place of wanting only
to help them; that it doesn't have an ulterior motive and that it
isn't just talking out of one's ass.","the person they're interacting with is not at all like other people
they've met.","books: siddartha, tibetan book of living and dying, sherlock

slapstick, and the rarely stupid-funny movie) and film noir. shaun

slevin, brick, kiss kiss bang bang make up the list of modern
movies. chinatown, bonnie and clyde, casablanca and the maltese
falcon are some of the classics.<br />

music: recently, it's socially conscious hip-hop: blue scholars,
common market, ethx, boots riley and the coup. and any music that's
been touched by tom morello and zack de la rocha.. rage against the
machine, the nightwatchman, one day as a lion, and especially

cowardice.<br />

as an example, on the brain sex tests
(http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/humanbody/sex/index_cookie.shtml) i
score very strongly on both masculine and feminine dimensions,
strong in math and science but also high marks in empathy and
feelings. sooooo, lately i've been thinking and reading about

""/interests?i=gender-identity"">gender-identity</a> and sexual
orientation and <a class=""ilink"" href=
""/interests?i=transgender"">transgender</a> and <a class=""ilink""
href=""/interests?i=bigender"">bigender</a> or multi-gender topics,
leading to a number of questions: what does it mean to be male?
female? does it matter and why? crotch contents aren't a great
predictor of gender - there's some pretty masculine ""women"" and
feminine ""guys"" - so there's a disconnect between apparent sex and
gender. here's another: why is it that some webforms require a
salutation as mr or ms or mrs or miss - what difference does it
make and why should we care so much about others' gender? if we
didn't care so much, would women continue to make only 78% of what
men make, or would it be more even? all of which makes me wonder,
is our society too simple-minded in limiting to ""male"" and ""female""
and ""straight"" and ""gay""? did you know there's an effort to
recognize a third sex in some countries, and that some species have
8 sexes? and what about people like me who have components of male
&amp; female in our personalities, should we be considered two
spirit as in some of the american indian traditions?<br />
<br />
oh, ok, maybe this is getting deep but they asked what i was
thinking about...and yes i like to think about much more complex
things than ""what's for dinner?"" (tho of course i like to think of
that too). the takeaway is that i'm not afraid to use my brain :-)","relaxing at home, maybe headed out for a nice time with friends,

"i am not a pacifist, yet i choose to practice peace in every
moment. i am not religious or atheistic, yet i feel a spirit with
many names is present in all existence...i call it love. i am not
unshakable, yet i stand very well and deeply rooted. i am not
perfect, and have no need to be, yet i strive to create and inspire
greatness in this world. i am not wealthy, yet i lead a rich and
fulfilling life everyday. i am here, now...and i intend to make the
best of it.","my current pursuits involve creating and performing music that
heals universally...my main instrument is voice. i am an mc (which
means master of ceremonies), a poet, and singer. as much as i love
rhymes, nothing does me in like harmonizing live! i can even
harmonize at different intervals with myself (though i prefer
people to play with for the sort of thing). currently i'm
performing with 2 projects (mama crow ensemble
(funk-hip-hop-soul-folk-rock fusion) and wolf angel (underground
ascension hip hop in it's most eloquent form) and i am helping to
build three more projects: many elements (check us out at bandcamp)
chickenhead johnson, and my solo project simply called tajangelo
(both of which you can check out a little of at pressrewind.com).
every once in awhile you'll catch me droppin rhymes over dj mixes
in the bay area electronic scene. when i am not healing through
music, i am using other methods. from crystals to body work to
energy healing...whatever feels right, really, is what dictates
methodology.","i'm extremely good at helping people feel good! thankfully it's
what i enjoy doing as well...in that way i am fulfilled. i can
freestyle at an adept level and i cook a mean soup, among other
culinary delights. i have a natural gift when it comes to video
games, and i am extremely talented at assisting others with
mental/emotional hurdles to overcome. i am a gifted light-worker
and exceptional wordsmith...among a few to mention.","my eyes and my gentle aura are what get the most initial
attention...and my beard (goatee...whatever).","i don't ask much, so long as the subject has substance. i don't
usually play favorites. the only thing i request is that it does
not bore me, is not completely predictable, and doesn't kill
braincells too quickly because it has nothing to offer for my
psyche...i mean hell...""dogma!"" now there is a movie with
substance!...a lot of dick and fart jokes too, yet i can easily
forgive mr. kevin smith because as sideline as his humor may be,

either thinking about sex or music and there ain't enough music in
the world to get my mind offa sex!!! maybe it's the scorpio in me
or maybe this that or the other thing but honestly, i feel no need
for reasons or excuses because i am proud to be a sexual being! i
mean, it's pretty much the one thing we're physically built for as
a species! it has excellent healing potential...what else can turn
a ""fuck you!"" into a ""oh god yes, fuck me!"" type of scenario? don't
get me wrong, sex is not all i am seeking, it is just on my mind a
lot.","usually either preforming, dancing til i sweat good at some
underground, or kickin it with the homies freestyling.","the last serious and committed relationship i had involved a lot of
fighting and yelling, which i don't get down with, and this is
probably a big reason why i'm not into ""serious"" relationships
these days. i don't do well with other people trying to force me
onto their trips so unconsentual domination and emotional vampires
need not apply.","you've got the stamina for honest and true connection on any level

am kind of short. they go ""whoa, where is redflowers8? i thought
she was coming, but i don't see here anywhere!"" as i take steps

imagination, absurdity, and mild romance.<br />

music: songs that use the notes from a-g, and their sharped and
flatted friends. i prefer quarter notes over sixty-fourth notes -

striving to one-up the awesomeness of the previous day.",fridays are rarely typical.,... ask?,"you like to do fun things outside.<br />
you like to go urban exploring.<br />
you're okay with exchanging messages for a while before asking to
meet me in person.<br />
your interest is purely platonic."
"i'm driven by curiosity &amp; explorations which sometimes takes me
on madcap adventurous, usually exciting, sometimes dangerous.<br />
<br />
""what's behind that door that says do not enter?"" or ""what if...?""
are two of my favorite questions to answer?<br />
<br />
i'm a free spirit... love living in the moment, but i also love to
work hard and play harder. yes! i'm rarely bored.<br />
<br />
my world view is rooted in my happy-go-lucky-everything-will-work
attitude towards most things, because it mostly does. that's not to
say i'm laid back; i'm actually goal oriented and have taken on
creative projects which have found commercial success.<br />
<br />
i could take the easy way out and reduce myself to a list of
adjectives. mine would probably include eclectic, creative,
ambitious, driven and fearless. add generous, genuine, present and
thoughtful and you start to get closer to who i am. but still these
adjectives don't even come close to painting the full picture.","most everything i do is geared towards gaining and retaining a
level of independence from societal constraints &amp; conventions.","- making friends and keeping them. i love new encounters and their
perspectives<br />
<br />
- finding inspiration in everything<br />
<br />
- sharing<br />
<br />
- asking the right questions and solving problems<br />
<br />
- playing devil's advocate<br />
<br />
- traveling unconventionally through uncertain lands<br />
<br />
- dancing<br />
<br />
- brainstorming<br />
<br />
- scuba diving<br />
<br />
- laughing at myself before anyone else does which is
semi-frequent<br />
<br />
- and, as my friends will attest to, i'm really really good at
finding parking spots...almost always!","my happy-go-lucky smile (life is good... mostly)<br />
<br />
my unidentifiable ethnicity<br />
<br />
my hair","dancing is one of my favorite forms of expression...especially, if
it has a jazzy sassy sway, or to the other end, with a hard driving
minimal beat - mostly electronic, sometimes not.<br />
<br />
for music...if i'm in a chill mood, i like classical
symphony...love the piano's whimsical notes to the sad strings of
bach's cello. i also like to chill to tunes like men sear by
bebe, or the whole hotel costes collection. on the other hand, i go
back to led zeppelin or leap forward to some
hard-hitting-in-your-face minimal tech when i'm in the mood to
rock. in addition, i love billy holiday, charlie parker, and many
others...plus there's something timeless about those standards.
otherwise, i love just about every form of music there is, and
something good is often playing in the background.<br />
<br />
i love written words and how they're strung together like musical
notes. one of my favorite authors is tom robbins for his masterful
use of metaphors. i'm a big douglas adams freak! i also love
anything on history...hard to know where you're going if you don't
know where you're from.<br />
<br />
my favorite movies include the big lebowski, across the universe,
heaven &amp; earth, the godfather trilogy, life is beautiful, dr.
strangelove, doctor zhivago, lawrence of arabia, inception, and
most documentaries...which i think will be my next pursuit..<br />
<br />
i don't watch much tv, but when i do... it's usually the daily
show, frontline, 60 minutes, and curb your enthusiasm. one of my
all time favorite shows was the west wing... it sucked when they
canceled it, but my very favorite show is true blood, 'cause they
don't hold anything back.<br />
<br />
i love all foods flavorful, succulent, hot, and sometimes with a
crunch.","aside from basic necessities, i like to think there's nothing i can
do without, but if i must...then most everything i absolutely need
can be, or already is, digitized and uploaded to a 16 gig memory
card.","all things fun - projects and travel plans.<br />
<br />
sorry i know this is a cop-out answer, but i can go on forever on
this one, which brings me to another thing - i spend a lot of time
thinking about...time, and how to use it more wisely!","out with friends listening &amp; dancing to one of my favorite djs
and shooting a party","i love to debate religion, politics &amp; history... but for the
most part i'm not the ""private"" type to begin with, so this
question is somewhat irrelevant. seek &amp; you shall find!","my business is involved in the social entertainment industry so i
don't have a problem meeting women. however quality women seem to
be scarce. i'm looking for a feminine woman who can also mix it up
like a tom boy. a woman who is inquisitive and has an adventurous
nature and a spontaneous streak. you'll need to be ambitious and
driven to continuously better yourself. i'd love my partner to be
supportive and encouraging. i think a healthy relationship is when
1+1 = 3. and if you play devil's advocate, enjoys asking questions,
have opinions but is open minded to other points of view. and if
you love to dance, kiss, and flirt; well, that woman just might
convince me this online dating thing can produce sublime
results.<br />
<br />
physical attraction is somewhat important and while i would love to
find a woman who is both beautiful on the inside and sexy on the
outside, inner beauty wins if i'm forced to choose. physically
however; i find women with big eyes, luscious lips and smooth skin
exceptional. bonus if you are fit and sport gorgeous curves."
"i am more and more realizing that i probably shouldn't seek some
kind of relationship right now since my all consuming hatred for
the living grows stronger each day. i mean, i made the effort to
get out there and in the end i feel that making this attempt to
find some female companion in any capacity will only throw gasoline
on the bonfire that is my anger. i guess i will look at this site
occasionally and i will respond if i receive a message but i think
at the moment my thirst for vengeance and the destruction of all
that is material is far too great to quell. anyway, if you really
want to know i'm a college student making next to nothing. i am a
heterosexual male and yes i do find sex appealing but i have a near
violent aversion to it due to a previous relationship and i view
all who can enjoy carnal pleasures with bitter contempt and
jealously. i bear similar feelings towards those who hold hands in
public. it's not their fault, i am just angry and bitter. i am
often described as morose and an amazing orson welles look alike.
it's been nearly a year and i am still not over my ex girlfriend.
it was with her that my ability to trust another human being died.
i have since mastered the ability to appear like i trust someone
without actually needing to rely on anyone. people tell me i am
very nice... i din't believe them.","well, you're still here. i guess i should tell you where i'm at. i
make art for a living, and by art i mean i make tee-shirt designs
for family reunions, childrens sports teams, and funerals. for some
reason people like to wear the visage of their recently deceased
relative on an american apperal shirt. either way, going to one of

guess.<br />

being facetious then leave now. everything i have disclosed to you
is the absolute truth. i decided to start with some of the more
terrifying facts and withhold a majority of the good. you can

"things i like: cooking/baking for friends, reading (fiction,
magazines, newspapers), exploring san francisco, traveling, trivia
night, animals, games (board, card, online), margaritas/mexican
food, live music, and spending time with my family and friends ...
i think as long as you're with fun people, it doesn't really matter
what you're doing. and i inherited my dad's interest in football -
i mostly watch pro because their games are usually on sunday, but i
like to catch college games, too.<br />
<br />
about me: i grew up in montana, in a very, very rural area (100
miles to the nearest wal-mart!). my parents still farm and ranch
there, and i try to go home and visit a couple times a year. i went
to a fancy private college on the east coast, and the culture shock
was, to put it mildly, immense - but i got a great education! i
studied history &amp; literature (american), focusing on women's
writing, native american history, the ""frontier,"" autobiography,
popular culture, protest/radicalism ... okay, maybe ""focus"" isn't
the right verb.<br />
<br />
boston wasn't really my kind of place, and i was excited to head
west again after graduation. i worked back in montana for a couple
years before moving to california in 2010. i love the bay area and,
honestly, i might never leave : ) i've made great friends here, and
the weather makes me really, really happy (most of the time).<br />
<br />
i think i'm a pretty laid-back, easygoing person. i try not to take
things too seriously - don't sweat the small stuff, right? i have
kind of a dry, sarcastic sense of humor (occasionally bordering on
caustic, or so i'm told), and i always try to find the humor in
every situation.","i'm in law school, but i promise i am not actually a horrible
person! (at least, i try not to be.) i hope to do public interest
law once i get my degree. i'm interested in environmental law,
civil rights, employment discrimination ...",problem-solving - which is why i went to law school.,"well, i'm not ""other people,"" so i'm not entirely sure, but i would
guess it's probably my hair, because it usually looks pretty
terrible. (i think it looks unusually nice in this photo.)","books: jane eyre - all-time favorite, hands down. recent reads -
serena, by ron rash (unbelievable, seriously - wow); the story of
edgar sawtelle, by david wroblewski (yeah, i know it was an oprah
book club pick, but i liked it anyway); cutting for stone, by
abraham verghese (bawled like a baby); the gargoyle, by andrew
davidson (strange and amazing); the thousand autumns of jacob de
zoet (incredible).<br />
<br />
random sampling of favorite movies: no country for old men, there
will be blood, pride and prejudice (ehle/firth version), public
enemies, lotr, the english patient, mean girls, dumb and dumber,
cold mountain, casablanca, any great period drama - why are no
examples coming to mind?<br />
<br />
tv shows: arrested development. i used to love the office, but the
last few seasons have been underwhelming. also really like 30 rock,
damages, the good wife, sex and the city, rome, boston legal, and
jeopardy!. i'm a sucker for trebek.<br />
<br />
food: i have a serious weakness for mexican food, and i love
italian too. also, burgers, chocolate, satsuma mandarins,
strawberries, white wine, toscano black pepper cheese (from tj's -
amazing!).","- books<br />

no holds barred. i accept others points of view and never force my
opinion on others.<br />
<br />
i do not rely on others to get things done for me. i am very
independent and can fix things on my own.<br />

i'm not martha stewart, but i can cook! i thank all the women in my
life for these skills.<br />

i am a sports fan, maybe even a bit more than you! ok, maybe not.

in life, and keeps me curious.","well i just finished my mba in sustainable mngmt, while i have been

"first of all, these little descriptions of ourselves drive me
absolutely batty. i feel that i could enter dozens of different
descriptions, each one completely different yet also completely
accurate in describing who i am. it is very hard to pinpoint who i
am, i feel that i lack a defined definition.<br />
with that said....<br />
lately my general life philosophy is try to find the beauty and
good in everything, especially in the small things. appreciate
every moment and just let the hard ones roll off you.<br />
try to have fun, i can manage to in almost any situation. i do not
take life too seriously and just try to enjoy as it much as
possible.<br />
i am big on chasing every dream you can. far too often we limit
ourselves on what we think we can achieve and i firmly believe you
can accomplish anything you set your mind to if you are motivated
enough and don't back down or compromise yourself.<br />
i embrace being out of my element or comfort zone, it is there you
can really find out who you are. i especially feel this when
traveling or meeting new people and thoroughly enjoy it.<br />
i love to cook, spend time outdoors, play with my dog, roam about
in the city, have lengthy intellectual conversation that may or not
lead to anything important and go on adventures with no real
destination.","i have decided to go back to school. i started off going back to be
photography major and now i am an anthropology major and will be
going for an advanced degree.<br />

down.<br />
lately between school, work and most my close friends being married
i have been sort of a homebody. i will get out of something seems
interesting and grabs my attention, but i am completely content
reading, watching tv or just relaxing after a long day.","staying up late. cooking incredible meals. cuddling on a rainy day.
saying something off the wall and being a goofball. finding clever
gifts for people.","i constantly am told i look way younger than i am. i believe this
has to be a combination of physical appearance as well as a
youthful persona i have.","i will read anything if it is good, but i find myself usually
steering towards science fiction. some of my favorite recent reads
are:<br />
the alienist, snowcrash, a song of fire and ice, the wheel of time,
the alchemist, the vampire lestat.<br />
i love most movies including mind-wrenching, horrible plot, b rated

"i honestly enjoy what i do. someone once described computer science
as ""ecstatic creation"", and i agree. it doesn't replace my other
interests, but i'm pretty happy doing it 40+ hours a week.<br />
<br />
i do believe in work-life balance though, and try to maintain
hobbies away from a keyboard. i like hosting dinner parties for my
friends, biking up hills, and staying up late playing guitar in my
bedroom. i dearly miss rowing and being out on the water. i still
read books.<br />
<br />
personality-wise, i'm a motivated, self-aware person. i try not to
be a perfectionist, but i do have high standards for myself. i have
an easy smile though, and i'm optimistic about life in general. i
think i'm a good listener; sometimes i play the role of armchair
psychotherapist for my friends, and in turn i'm an open
communicator too.<br />

i'm a transplant to the bay area from the east coast. i consciously
made an effort to come out to california after undergrad because i
needed a change of pace, and so far i'm loving it.","for the summer i'm working at a tech startup in sf, but the rest of
the year i'm a cs grad student at berkeley. ultimately, i want to
end up as a high school computer science teacher since i really
like working with students, but somewhere between now and then i
want to do something really aspirational that leverages my cs
skills. no master plan yet though!","making eggs, be it omelette, scrambled, or fried. i can even do

lot if i play basketball; i'm not that tall!","books: anything by neil gaiman, terry pratchett, neal stephenson,

"it's always awkward providing a self summary, partially because i
cant write well enough to describe myself and because i'm not sure
how much a paragraph can actually describe someone. i'm laid back,

me section on facebook. i've never ventured into the online dating
world and actually consider filling this profile out as ""putting
myself out there"".<br />
<br />
i find talking about myself rather difficult, so here goes.<br />

my last name is a variation of the latin word veritas, which means
truth. i try to live up to that. i'm an honest person and have even
been accused of being too honest.<br />

i believe in karma. i'm a big believer and live accordingly. there

drive, needy men, a man without a sense of humor, disrespectful,
liars...<br />

i live in the community where i grew up and i love it! i've never
moved too far from the bay and i consider myself lucky to have
access to all that the bay area offers us! my siblings are all in
the area and i have a lot of long time friends in the area who i
also consider family.<br />
<br />
i'm really attracted to tall, laid back guys who are handy. i'm not
saying strictly blue collar or anything, but for me, there is
nothing sexier than a manly man! i guess i'm sort of traditional
when it comes to dating, i'm not one to ask a guy out (doesn't mean
i don't wish i could) so don't be shy fellas! a recent experience
made me realize i need to add something here...i believe men should
be somewhat chivalrous and i'm talking basic stuff, like maybe
pumping gas for me, or helping to carry in groceries.<br />

music is super important to me! jack johnson is my favorite male
artist, joan osborne is my favorite female artist, and incubus is
my favorite band. i absolutely love music and will listen to
anything, but alternative rock dominates my world.<br />
<br />
i love food. i love to eat. i love to cook. my friends and i have
regular cooking competitions and i'm a recent chicken wing champ
and i won the first ever competition we had, which was garlic

another man. i am looking forward to moving past one-nighters and
beginning a healthy relationship. if we find that there is mutual
interest on here, we can meet for a low-pressure lunch and/or
coffee somewhere and get to know more about each other. if there is
a match, great, if not, at least we have made a new friend. i am
trying to look deeper than my superficial wants

don't-wants (*cough*facial hair, shaved-bodies, piercings*cough*),
but i know that those still might be significant factors. rather

maturity, sense of humor, adventurous*cough*), i would rather

<br />
""i am adventurous, thoughtful, and enigmatic"" according to my caf
gratitude profile. +1 points if you know the place. ;-)","i was a software developer in my past life, working on all kinds of
cool projects, but i got burned out in the game industry and
decided to start something new. or restart something - i taught
skydiving for about 7 years, loved it, and am now on the path
towards getting my degree (all of my programming stuff was
self-taught) and my teaching credentials. right now, i'm half-time
student and half-time teaching, and loving every minute of it.
well. almost every minute of it. ;-)",...listening.,"..that i shut up and listen. i ask a lot of questions to someone
that i've just met - i genuinely want to know more about you before
diving into conversation. it gives me some context and
common-ground, and i think that it gives you the (correct) notion
that i actually care what you think.","books: i like a lot of cyberpunk, dystopic, weird (to me) kinds of
books. real thought provoking mind-benders.. you'll catch me
mostly, however, reading a lot of geeky technical journals, though,
when i'm not deep in the books for school.<br />
<br />
movies: most kinds, but i probably prefer pretty intense movies
that require a lot of thought while watching them (momento,
inception, the matrix, etc.). i enjoy a surprise twist or two (the
prestige, usual suspects, etc...), but not at the expense of good
storytelling (m. night shyamalan i'm looking squarely at you). i'll
watch a heart-warmers if they've got something more than a cloying
premise (princess bride, christmas story). i've also been known to
indulge in a horror movie or two (hellraiser, aliens, etc...). or
three... i'm also a huge fan of mystery science theater 3000 &amp;
rifftrax. oh, and my cousin vinnie.<br />
<br />
shows: a lot of adult swim stuff: aqua teen hunger force, archer,
frisky dingo, sealab 2021, etc. for ""real people"" shows, a lot of
comedies, particularly if they're from overseas: the mighty boosh,
the it crowd, little britain, etc. some quirky/geeky shows: eureka,
dr. who, etc. i'm also addicted to law &amp; order and some of its
offshoots: svu, crime unit, etc.<br />
<br />
music: i like two opposite extremes: raw, digital, industrial,
experimental, noisy ebm .. and a lot of classical. there's not much
in-between except a handful of bands: jane's addiction, smashing
pumpkins, ... pop music tends to make me just plain angry.. and sad
for us at the same time. ;-)<br />
<br />
food: wide, wide variety. not a picky eater at all .. love a lot of
ethnic foods from overseas (thai, japanese, korean, pakistani,
etheopian, etc.). i have been a vegetarian for a greater part of my
life now, and still plan on it from here on out. however, if you
check out my q&amp;a, you'll see that it's a choice for /me/, and i
won't upend a table at a restaurant in indignation if you order a
steak. well, maybe if you ordered veal or foie gras.. ;-)","- my closest friends<br />
- my closest enemies<br />
- my multi-processors (both wetware and hardware)<br />
- challenging physical activity<br />
- being able to finish lists - especially if they are egocentric.","schoolwork and any teaching that is coming up. it's pretty much
all-encompassing right now, but the end is in sight .. well, the
degree and the credentials part at least...","unwinding after a long school-week. it used to be a beer and a
cigar, but that's coming to a screeching halt. well .. it's
stopping quickly. well .. it's tapering off. -heh-","that i work too hard. that i'm too optimistic. that i can't stop

"i'm just an english fella who likes to have a little fun and to
meet nice people. i guess my friends would say that i'm a bit of
'lovable odd ball'. entertaining, witty, and sharp as a banana.
..don't know. ..i make friends easily i guess (which is surprising
because i'm a cheeky lil' monkey!).<br />
<br />
i'd like to meet someone special.. .you know, someone who you feel
like you've known for years. it's a tall order for a fish out of
water like myself, but i'll stick at it.. .it'll happen.!<br />
<br />
.. .my facial topiary often changes! :d~","i'm just now getting back into the mountain biking and climbing
after some injuries, and i have my first motorcycle track planned
for real soon!! whoop-whoop!<br />
<br />
i used to be a stop motion animator back in england, but these days
i earn my crust as a computer animator.. .currently i'm animating a
moose and a squirrel.<br />
<br />
i used to get my biggest jollies from creating, and i still love
that, but what really inspires me these days is helping others with
there work. i love the feeling of making a creative connection with
another artist.","teaching.<br />
kicking ass on the dance floor.<br />
2 wheeled shenanigans.<br />
rubicks cube. (nerd.. .sorry!)<br />
sneezing and hiccuping my head off.!<br />

rock climbing with style.<br />
kissing.","people notice my big smile, my groovy dance moves, and my fantastic
socks.. .because i show them in the elevator (spread the joy
baby!)<br />

just recently i discovered that some people initially think i'm a
bad ass because of the way i look. i'd love for this true, but it's
just not.. .underneath the mustache and the biker gear i'm just a
sweet, cheeky fella. ha-ha.. .call me 'sweet cheeks!'","lists are boring.. .better to talk about why rather than
what:<br />
films that take me on a powerful journey (and sci fi).<br />
music that turns on my funk, or eggs me to spin a lady.<br />
books that are tapes.<br />
pod casts that educate.<br />
trails that inspire me to fly.<br />
food that makes my body work (and chocolate).<br />
climbs that i can work out with friends.<br />
art that chokes me up.","fun, creativity, playful mischief, hugs, passion, cheeky friends, 2
wheeled things, coffee shops.",". ..bouncing around on my trials bike, how to solve rock climbing
problems, how to help people communicate.",". ..catching up with friends over a pint or a game of pool, food..
.what ever really!? friends is the important part of the
equation!<br />
if i'm off on an adventure in the morning then i'll be investing in
a good nights kip.. .zz.. z.. .","one morning i discovered a mole on my body, this was a little
worrying. however, upon further investigation i discovered that
instead of being a malignant growth, it was in fact yummy
chocolate.. .score! :d<br />
<br />
later that evening.. .after 10 minutes of pushing the button and
complaining, it dawned on me that it wouldn't eject because there
wasn't a disc in it.! :)",". ..you're an intelligent, nerdy, a girlie tom boy (what ever the
f* that means?), goofy, and you can swear/make stupid faces!
perhaps the words 'sexy ass kicker' have been leveled at you once
or twice. blagh!!!.. .don't know.. .just say 'hi' if you fancy a
laugh and think that we might get along. :d"
"i am down-to-earth, kind, funny and not overly impressed by
materialism. i believe that work should be meaningful and there
should be some quality play time in one's life. i enjoy the
outdoors, but have a variety of interests. most importantly, i'm
willing to learn, compromise, and be a part of an intimate,
romantic relationship.","i've made my career in the nonprofit world. for fun, i listen to
npr, play scrabble, hike, read, watch ""small"" movies, root for the
giants, and do much more. i'm interested in building my friendship
network as well as meeting a great woman.","listening, working on emotional honesty, laughing with people,
math, managing money.",that would probably be my smile.,"i recently read great house by nicole krauss. she an excellent
young writer - the history of love is her best. my favorite movie
is called local hero - have you heard of it? i just saw sophie's
choice for the first time - powerful stuff. watch little tv and no
reality shows (i'm working on my own reality), but i love old
twilight zone episodes. my musical tastes these days lead me to
sarah mclachlan, dar williams, suzanne vega, dan mangan and erin
mccarley. food? you name it and very likely i like it :)","1. friends<br />

25+ years and how i can deepen and expand my friendships.","out at my friends' house hanging with their kids or doing a meetup
event. i also will stay in some fridays and just chill.","at my recent physical the doctor said i'm in better shape than
99.9% of 52 year-old men. i guess i'll have to try harder!",you're ready for the real thing and think we might be a good match.
"for those of you wanting the cliff notes: i'm a lover of love,
truth, beauty, adventure, song, robin hood, a good laugh, and
shoes. :-)<br />
<br />
for everyone else: i am one part city girl, and at least one part
country. smart. funny. warm. down to earth. thoughtful. eternally
curious. big hearted. saucy.<br />
<br />
i have a reverence for the natural world, truth, beauty, humor,
courage and compassion. admiration for anyone with the ability to
think outside the box. a love of music, the arts, good stories,
water, most things physical (which i owe in part to my tomboy
roots), food, photography, cooking, camping, travel and more....and
the lovely, funny, smart, big-hearted and sometimes quirky friends
and family in my life.<br />
<br />
i'm gainfully employed, and trying to do right by the planet,
people, and me. it is an imperfect effort but interesting,
satisfying and fun most of the time!<br />
<br />
i think one of secrets to happiness is the ability to savor simple
pleasures, and i'm pretty good at this.<br />
<br />
i'm here in pursuit of a relationship of substance. some of what
floats my boat in a man: 44-55ish, healthy, fit, sharp mind,
youthful, sense of humor, glass half full outlook, comfortable in
your skin, passions and pursuits of your own, a belief in the
golden rule, a man of integrity, good communicator and listener,
straight shooter, sensual, strong body, and a big heart. :-)","perfecting my sangria recipe. trying to keep my inner tomboy
satisfied. reading. making music (an incredibly fun and humbling
pursuit!). taking pictures. becoming a better cook. spending time
with the people i love. lingering in bodies of water whenever
possible. squeezing in some travel to distant lands. being
grateful.","- savoring simple pleasures<br />

of boots.","consider me a omnivore on most fronts... really, too many to list!
music from all genres and all over the globe. almost anything
created with real heart and soul will get my attention. i don't own
a tv, and i am something of a public radio junkie (fresh air,
philosophy talk, the moth story hour, to the best of our knowledge
...). and have i mentioned how much i love food? ahhh, food... and
movies - eclectic tastes there too but i cannot resist the coen
bros, for example and am surprised how much i liked midnight in
paris... and books - i read empire of the summer moon recently
which was both thrilling and a heartbreaker, trawler - a crazy,
magical true story of one man's absurd quest, ann patchett's state
of wonder - good, but not as good as bel canto...and am now reading
kitchen counter cooking school - human and funny...","love<br />

great love. the irresistible pull of water. where will i travel
next? will we humans pull it together, or are we really going to
trash the planet? is there a way to be an ethical modern day robin
hood? how much i love food, and what's for dinner...","if it's been a heck of a work week, i have known to be sound asleep
by 9pm. typically though, there will be good food, good drink, and
good conversation. if i'm really lucky, some music too.","that i'm something of a dork, and that i love dorks - it's such an
underrated quality!","...you're thinking - hubba hubba! :-)<br />

meaningful connection with a quality woman..."
